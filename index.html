		<em>Glittermitten Grove</em>, also known as "the <em>Frog Fractions</em> ARG sequel,"
		contains a section where the text of Dante's <em>Inferno</em> can be read.
		It <em>also</em> provides a "New Game Plus" version of <em>Inferno</em>, in which the
		character of Virgil has been replaced with Macho Man Randy Savage.

		<em>INFERNO - NEW GAME PLUS</em>
