# Dump of Dante's Inferno - New Game Plus
## from *Glittermitten Grove* (aka *Frog Fractions 2*)

*Glittermitten Grove*, also known as "the *Frog Fractions* ARG sequel,"
contains a section where the text of Dante's *Inferno* can be read.
It *also* provides a "New Game Plus" version of *Inferno*, in which the
character of Virgil has been replaced with Macho Man Randy Savage.

I could not find this text anywhere on the web. In the interest of
preservation, I here provide the full text of *INFERNO - NEW GAME PLUS*,
as dumped from the game files.
