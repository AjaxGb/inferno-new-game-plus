<body><h1>I N F E R N O</h1>
<h1>N E W  G A M E  P L U S</h1>
<h3>By Dante Alighieri</h3>
<h2>CANTO I.</h2>
<div>Midway upon the journey of our life
I found myself within a forest dark,
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
Which in the very thought renews the fear.
So bitter is it, death is little more;
But of the good to treat, which there I found,
Speak will I of the other things I saw there.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
So full was I of slumber at the moment
In which I had abandoned the true way.
But after I had reached a mountain's foot,
At that point where the valley terminated,
Which had with consternation pierced my heart,
Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,
Vested already with that planet's rays
Which leadeth others right by every road.
Then was the fear a little quieted
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>That in my heart's lake had endured throughout
The night, which I had passed so piteously.
And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
Turns to the water perilous and gazes;
So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
Which never yet a living person left.
After my weary body I had rested,
The way resumed I on the desert slope,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>So that the firm foot ever was the lower.
And lo! almost where the ascent began,
A panther light and swift exceedingly,
Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!
And never moved she from before my face,
Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
That many times I to return had turned.
The time was the beginning of the morning,
And up the sun was mounting with those stars
That with him were, what time the Love Divine
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>At first in motion set those beauteous things;
So were to me occasion of good hope,
The variegated skin of that wild beast,
The hour of time, and the delicious season;
But not so much, that did not give me fear
A lion's aspect which appeared to me.
He seemed as if against me he were coming
With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;
And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
And many folk has caused to live forlorn!
She brought upon me so much heaviness,
With the affright that from her aspect came,
That I the hope relinquished of the height.
And as he is who willingly acquires,
And the time comes that causes him to lose,
Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,
E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,
Which, coming on against me by degrees
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.
While I was rushing downward to the lowland,
Before mine eyes did one present himself,
Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.
When I beheld him in the desert vast,
'Have pity on me,' unto him I cried,
'Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!'
He answered me: A man;  a macho man I am,
And both my parents were of Ohio,
And American by country both of them.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>'Randy Poffo' was I born, though it was late,
And lived at Columbus under the good Eisenhower,
During the time of the war in Vietnam.
An athlete was I, and I batted in the minors
those red birds of Saint Louis, Cardinals,
Before the Macho Man took to combat.
But brother, why are you going back to such annoyance?
Why aren't you heading up to heaven instead,
Where all the good people always go?'
'Now, art thou that Macho Man and that fighter
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>To whom there is no limit but the sky?'
I made response to him with bashful forehead.
'O, of the other wrestlers honour and light,
Avail me the long study and great love
That have impelled me to explore thy technique!
Thou art my master, and my author thou,
Thou art alone the one from whom I took
The beautiful style that has done honour to me.
Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;
Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.'
'You should head to somewhere less grody,'
Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
'Unlike me, you cannot afford to look ridiculous;
Because this beast, at which you are raging,
Doesn't ever let anybody past her,
She'll mess you up something wicked;
She, like me, is a tower of power
She is funky like a monkey and hungry too,
And after food is hungrier than before.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Let me tell you something buddy,
She may be strong but compared to her I'm stronger!
She better watch out because I'm coming for her.
You cannot hide or run from the Nacho Man,
My arm is long and my eyes see into space;
There is no nation that is not the Nacho Nation;
Of all the world I am the savior,
Pedal to the metal!  Everybody knows it!
Oh yeah, let me tell you what I'll do;
Through every city shall I will hunt her down,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Until I have driven her back to Hell,
Where some weaksauce demon let her loose.
I know what's best and what is MACHO!
Follow me buddy, and I will be your guide,
We're going to have a real adventure.
You're going to see some pretty gnarly stuff
Some ancient ghosts and boogums that go woo,
Maybe you'll be sad if you're a wuss;
You'll also see some pretty happy folks
They're happy mostly because I visit them,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Everybody treasures a visit from the Nacho;
If you want to go to heaven afterwords,
To meet your ladyfriend or whatever;
That's where we'll part ways I guess;
Because that rightious dude who rules heaven,
Has tasked me with bringing macho madness
To those less fortunate, so I remain.
Heaven is the most macho city of all;
And until all are macho I must wait;
This is my holy task, a righteous one.'
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>And I to him: 'Sir, I thee entreat,
By that same God whom thou didst never know,
So that I may escape this woe and worse,
Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,
That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,
And those thou makest so disconsolate.'
Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.
</div>
<h2>CANTO II.</h2>
<div>Day was departing, and the embrowned air
Released the animals that are on earth
From their fatigues; and I the only one
Made myself ready to sustain the war,
Both of the way and likewise of the woe,
Which memory that errs not shall retrace.
O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!
O memory, that didst write down what I saw,
Here thy nobility shall be manifest!
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>And I began: 'Poet, who guidest me,
Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,
Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.
Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,
While yet corruptible, unto the world
Immortal went, and was there bodily.
But if the adversary of all evil
Was courteous, thinking of the high effect
That issue would from him, and who, and what,
To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>For he was of great Rome, and of her empire
In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;
The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,
Were stablished as the holy place, wherein
Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.
Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,
Things did he hear, which the occasion were
Both of his victory and the papal mantle.
Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,
To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Which of salvation's way is the beginning.
But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?
I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,
Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.
Therefore, if I resign myself to come,
I fear the coming may be ill-advised;
Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.'
And as he is, who unwills what he willed,
And by new thoughts doth his intention change,
So that from his design he quite withdraws,
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,
Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,
Which was so very prompt in the beginning.
'If the Macho Man catches your drift,'
Replied that shade of the Champion,
'You're a giant coward baby whiner,
And your lameness drags you down awful fierce,
It makes you shake like a sad puppydog,
Like some sort of weird lame animal thing.
Nevertheless stick with the Macho Man
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>And I'll tell you why I'm here right now
And why a champ like me would help you.
I was pumping iron at the gym one day,
When a hot lady ghost came up to me
I cannot refuse a pretty lady.
She had these killer eyes like wow;
And her voice really revved my engine,
Here's the madness that she spoke:
'O spirit courteous of Mantua,
Of whom the fame still in the world endures,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;
A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,
Upon the desert slope is so impeded
Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,
And may, I fear, already be so lost,
That I too late have risen to his succour,
From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.
Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,
And with what needful is for his release,
Assist him so, that I may be consoled.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;
I come from there, where I would fain return;
Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.
When I shall be in presence of my Lord,
Full often will I praise thee unto him.'
Then paused she, and thereafter I began:
Beatrice, you're super hot
I cannot resist. I'll do whatever you say.
Nobody else in heaven is as rad as you.
I'll happily do whatever you want
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>It's a pleasure to please a lady like you
Consider your every desire fulfilled
But could you do the Macho one favor
It's a lot of work you've asked me to do,
So if you could snap into a Slim Jim that'd be rad.'
'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,
Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,
'Why I am not afraid to enter here.
Of those things only should one be afraid
Which have the power of doing others harm;
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.
God in his mercy such created me
That misery of yours attains me not,
Nor any flame assails me of this burning.
A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves
At this impediment, to which I send thee,
So that stern judgment there above is broken.
In her entreaty she besought Lucia,
And said, 'Thy faithful one now stands in need
Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,
Hastened away, and came unto the place
Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.
'Beatrice' said she, 'the true praise of God,
Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,
For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?
Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?
Dost thou not see the death that combats him
Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?'
Never were persons in the world so swift
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>To work their weal and to escape their woe,
As I, after such words as these were uttered,
Came hither downward from my blessed seat,
Confiding in thy dignified discourse,
Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'
After she said all that stuff,
She was crying, my pecs left her in awe;
So I left before I could further blow her mind;
And so I found you like she wanted;
I totally rocked that wild monster,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>That was blocking your climb up the mountain.
So why is it you're being so lame?
What is holding back your Macho Spirit?
Why aren't you as cool as I am?
Given that three hot chicks are waiting
They're in Heaven right now watching the clock,
You can trust my word on that my friend.'
Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,
Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,
Uplift themselves all open on their stems;
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Such I became with my exhausted strength,
And such good courage to my heart there coursed,
That I began, like an intrepid person:
'O she compassionate, who succoured me,
And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon
The words of truth which she addressed to thee!
Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed
To the adventure, with these words of thine,
That to my first intent I have returned.
Now go, for one sole will is in us both,
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.'
Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,
I entered on the deep and savage way.
</div>
<h2>CANTO III.</h2>
<div>Through me the way is to the city dolent;
Through me the way is to eternal dole;
Through me the way among the people lost.
Justice incited my sublime Creator;
Created me divine Omnipotence,
The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.
Before me there were no created things,
Only eterne, and I eternal last.
All hope abandon, ye who enter in!'
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>These words in sombre colour I beheld
Written upon the summit of a gate;
Whence I: 'Their sense is, Master, hard to me!'
And he to me, as one experienced:
'Just don't be suspicious, lil' macho,
If you're scared then you'll never make it.
We're coming up to a lame-ass place
Full of bummed-out sad people
Who honestly are not the smartest.'
And after he had laid his hand on mine
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,
He led me in among the secret things.
There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud
Resounded through the air without a star,
Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.
Languages diverse, horrible dialects,
Accents of anger, words of agony,
And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,
Made up a tumult that goes whirling on
For ever in that air for ever black,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.
And I, who had my head with horror bound,
Said:'Master, what is this which now I hear?
What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?'
And he to me: 'The way they whine
And complain about being in pain
Teminds them that they're in pain.  It's weird.
They're basically just Angels who were selfish
I dunno, they didn't go for God or Satan
Mostly they just cared about themselves.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>They got kicked out of heaven
But Hell sure as hell won't take them,
So really they're like angel hobos.'
And I: 'O Master, what so grievous is
To these, that maketh them lament so sore?'
He answered: 'Alright, well in a nutshell.
They can't evr hope to die,
Their life as is ain't funky enough,
So they just envy everybody else.
They have no reputation at all;
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Good folks and bad both hate them.
So gawk if you want, but lets keep rolling.'
And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,
Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,
That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;
And after it there came so long a train
Of people, that I ne'er would have believed
That ever Death so many had undone.
When some among them I had recognised.
I looked, and I beheld the shade of him
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Who made through cowardice the great refusal.
Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,
That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches
Hateful to God and to his enemies.
These miscreants, who never were alive,
Were naked, and were stung exceedingly
By gadflies and by hornets that were there.
These did their faces irrigate with blood,
Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet
By the disgusting worms was gathered up.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And when to gazing farther I betook me.
People I saw on a great river's bank;
Whence said I: ' Master, now vouchsafe to me,
That I may know who these are, and what law
Makes them appear so ready to pass over,
As I discern athwart the dusky light.'
And he to me: 'Jesus Christ dude
You ask so many, TOO many questions
Once we get to the river you'll see.'
Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Fearing my words might irksome be to him,
From speech refrained I till we reached the river.
And lo! towards us coming in a boat
An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,
Crying: ' Woe unto you, ye souls depraved
Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;
I come to lead you to the other shore,
To the eternal shades in heat and frost.
And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,
Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead-
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>But when he saw that I did not withdraw,
He said:'By other ways, by other ports
Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for,passage;
A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.'
And unto him the Guide:'Vex thee not, Charon;
It is so willed there where is power to do
That which is willed; and farther question not.'
There at were quieted the fleecy cheeks
Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,
Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>But all those souls who weary were and naked
Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,
As soon as they had heard those cruel words.
God they blasphemed and their progenitors,
The human race, the place, the time, the seed
Of their engendering and of their birth!
Thereafter all together they drew back,
Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,
Which waiteth every man who fears not God.
Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Beckoning to them, collects them all together,
Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.
As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,
First one and then another, till the branch
Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;
In similar wise the evil seed of Adam
Throw themselves from that margin one by one,
At signals, as a bird unto its lure.
So they depart across the dusky wave,
And ere upon the other side they land,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Again on this side a new troop assembles.
'My son,'the courteous Master said to me,
'All those who perish in the wrath of God
Here meet together out of every land;
And ready are they to pass o'er the river,
Because celestial Justice spurs them on,
So that their fear is turned into desire.
This way there never passes a good soul;
And hence if Charon doth complain of thee
Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.'
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>This being finished, all the dusk champaign
Trembled so violently, that of that terror
The recollection bathes me still with sweat.
The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,
And fulminated a vermilion light,
'Which overmastered in me every sense,
And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.
</div>
<h2>CANTO IV.</h2>
<div>Broke the deep lethargy within my head
A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,
Like to a person who by force is wakened;
And round about I moved my rested eyes,
Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,
To recognise the place wherein I was.
True is it, that upon the verge I found me
Of the abysmal valley dolorous,
That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,
So that by fixing on its depths my sight
Nothing whatever I discerned therein.
'We're in space, and space is the place,'
Began the Champ, pallid utterly;
'The madness is running wild, and so shall you.'
And I, who of his colour was aware,
Said: 'How shall I come, if thou art afraid,
Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?'
And he to me: 'Let me tell you now a man
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>of my position can afford
to look ridiculous at any time.
Now let's go, follow the Nacho Man.'
Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter
The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.
There, as it seemed to me from listening,
Were lamentations none, but only sighs,
That tremble made the everlasting air.
And this arose from sorrow without torment,
Which the crowds had, that many were and great,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Of infants and of women and of men.
To me the Master good: 'Why don't you ask
Who these dead dudes you're looking at are?
Let me tell you about these chumps,
They didn't do anything really wrong,
But they could not snap into a Slim Jim
Because the Slim Jim had not yet been discovered;
And if they were before Sim Jims,
In the right manner they adored not jerkey;
They never knew the breakfast of champions.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>As a result, they can't go to heaven,
I am here as well, mostly to mock them
For I did not share my Slim Jims.'
Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,
Because some people of much worthiness
I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.
'Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,'
Began I, with desire of being certain
Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,
'Came any one by his own merit hence,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?'
And he, who understood my covert speech,
Replied: 'When I first got here,
When from the sky a long-haired dude appeared,
Almost as glorious as the Nacho Man himself.
He grabbed some Bible dudes, I  think they were
Abe and Abel and Noah's Ark but not Noah,
I think Moses was there too?  It was rad.
There were a bunch of others but honestly
I can't be bothered to remember right now
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>It really isn't important
Past, present, future,
It's the best there is. Ohhhh yeah.
And then that guy left and never came back.
We ceased not to advance because he spake,
But still were passing onward through the forest,
The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.
Not very far as yet our way had gone
This side the summit, when I saw a fire
That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>We were a little distant from it still,
But not so far that I in part discerned not
That honourable people held that place.
'O thou who honourest every art and science,
Who may these be, which such great honour have,
That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?'
And he to me: 'The honourable name,
That sounds of them above there in thy life,
Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.'
In the mean time a voice was heard by me:
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>'All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;
His shade returns again, that was departed.'
After the voice had ceased and quiet was,
Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;
Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.
To say to me began my gracious Champion:
'This is a Dude named Dante, and you know me,
The one for whom the sky is the limit.
That one is Andre, Wrestler sovereign;
Next to him is Bubba Rogers, the satirist;
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>The third is Roddy, and the last is Albano.
I knew these guys when I was alive
We fought and laughed and ate delicious nachos,
And now we chill for all eternity'
Thus I beheld assemble the fair school
Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,
Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.
When they together had discoursed somewhat,
They turned to me with signs of salutation,
And on beholding this, my Master smiled;
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,
In that they made me one of their own band;
So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.
Thus we went on as far as to the light,
Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,
As was the saying of them where I was.
We came unto a noble castle's foot,
Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,
Defended round by a fair rivulet;
This we passed over even as firm ground;
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;
We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.
People were there with solemn eyes and slow,
Of great authority in their countenance;
They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.
Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side
Into an opening luminous and lofty,
So that they all of them were visible.
There opposite, upon the green enamel,
Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.
I saw Sid Vicious with companions many,
'Mongst whom I knew both Nash and Wright,
Rodman in armour with gerfalcon eyes;
I saw Miss Madness and Madusa
On the other side, and saw Bret Hart,
Who with Pillman his buddy sat;
I saw that The Butcher who drove Sting forth,
And many others who I did not know,
And saw alone, apart, The Repo Man.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>When I had lifted up my brows a little,
The Master I beheld of those who know,
Sit with his slamtastic family.
All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.
There I beheld both Doink and Crush,
Who nearer him before the others stand;
Diesel, who puts the world on chance,
Bart Gunn, Shawn Michaels, and Lex Luger,
Razor Ramon, Mr. Perfect, and Albano;
Of qualities I saw the good collector,
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>The Valiant Brothers; and Steele saw I,
Bobo Brazil and Ladd, and The Famous Moolah,
Snuka, Arnold Skaaland, and Rodz,
Kowalski, Patterson, and Morales,
Gorilla Monsoon, who the worst announcer made.
I cannot all of them pourtray in full,
Because so drives me onward the long theme,
That many times the word comes short of fact.
The sixfold company in two divides;
Another way my sapient Guide conducts me
<aside class="versenum">150</aside>Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;
And to a place I come where nothing shines.
</div>
<h2>CANTO V.</h2>
<div>Thus I descended out of the first circle
Down to the second, that less space begirds,
And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.
There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;
Examines the transgressions at the entrance;
Judges, and sends according as he girds him.
I say, that when the spirit evil-born
Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;
And this discriminator of transgressions
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;
Girds himself with his tail as many times
As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.
Always before him many of them stand;
They go by turns each one unto the judgment;
They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.
'O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry
Comest,' said Minos to me, when he saw me,
Leaving the practice of so great an office,
'Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee.'
And unto him my Guide: 'Why criest thou too?
Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;
It is so willed there where is power to do
That which is willed; and ask no further question.'
And now begin the dolesome notes to grow
Audible unto me; now am I come
There where much lamentation strikes upon me.
I came into a place mute of all light,
Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>If by opposing winds 't is combated.
The infernal hurricane that never rests
Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;
Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.
When they arrive before the precipice,
There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,
There they blaspheme the puissance divine.
I understood that unto such a torment
The carnal malefactors were condemned,
Who reason subjugate to appetite.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>And as the wings of starlings bear them on
In the cold season in large band and full,
So doth that blast the spirits maledict;
It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;
No hope doth comfort them for evermore,
Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.
And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,
Making in air a long line of themselves,
So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,
Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Whereupon said I: 'Master, who are those
People, whom the black air so castigates?'
'Eh, you wouldn't know them really,
They were not macho or rad,' then said he unto me,
'That lady was a real piece of work.
She liked the men if you know what I mean
She made all sex legal all the time,
That way she could have all she liked.
Her name is Semiramis, of Assyria
And I'd like to _Syria_ her _Ass_ one day;
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>She was married to Ninus, a macho fellow.
Over there is one you may know,
She's hardcore, strapped asps to her tits;
aka Cleopatra the voluptuous.'
Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless
Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,
Who at the last hour combated with Love.
Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand
Shades did he name and point out with his finger,
Whom Love had separated from our life.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>After that I had listened to my Teacher,
Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,
Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.
And I began: 'O Poet, willingly
Speak would I to those two, who go together,
And seem upon the wind to be so light.'
And, he to me: 'Cool your jets bro
You can speak to them soon enough, soon enough
They'll come to us looking for love.'
Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>My voice uplift I: 'O ye weary souls!
Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.'
As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,
With open and steady wings to the sweet nest
Fly through the air by their volition borne,
So came they from the band where Dido is,
Approaching us athwart the air malign,
So strong was the affectionate appeal.
'O living creature gracious and benignant,
Who visiting goest through the purple air
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,
If were the King of the Universe our friend,
We would pray unto him to give thee peace,
Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.
Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,
That will we hear, and we will speak to you,
While silent is the wind, as it is now.
Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,
Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends
To rest in peace with all his retinue.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,
Seized this man for the person beautiful
That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.
Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,
Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,
That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;
Love has conducted us unto one death;
Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!'
These words were borne along from them to us.
As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>I bowed my face, and so long held it down
Until the Poet said to me: 'Whaddaya think?'
When I made answer, I began: 'Alas!
How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,
Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!'
Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,
And I began: 'Thine agonies, Francesca,
Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.
But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,
By what and in what manner Love conceded,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>That you should know your dubious desires?'
And she to me: 'There is no greater sorrow
Than to be mindful of the happy time
In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.
But, if to recognise the earliest root
Of love in us thou hast so great desire,
I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.
One day we reading were for our delight
Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.
Alone we were and without any fear.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Full many a time our eyes together drew
That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;
But one point only was it that o'ercame us.
When as we read of the much-longed-for smile
Being by such a noble lover kissed,
This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,
Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.
Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.
That day no farther did we read therein.'
And all the while one spirit uttered this,
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>The other one did weep so, that, for pity,
I swooned away as if I had been dying,
And fell, even as a dead body falls.
</div>
<h2>CANTO VI.</h2>
<div>At the return of consciousness, that closed
Before the pity of those two relations,
Which utterly with sadness had confused me,
New torments I behold, and new tormented
Around me, whichsoever way I move,
And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.
In the third circle am I of the rain
Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;
Its law and quality are never new.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,
Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;
Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.
Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,
With his three gullets like a dog is barking
Over the people that are there submerged.
Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,
And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;
He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.
Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>One side they make a shelter for the other;
Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.
When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!
His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;
Not a limb had he that was motionless.
And my Conductor, with his spans extended,
Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,
He threw it into those rapacious gullets.
Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,
And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,
The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed
Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders
Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.
We passed across the shadows, which subdues
The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet
Upon their vanity that person seems.
They all were lying prone upon the earth,
Excepting one, who sat upright as soon
As he beheld us passing on before him.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>'O thou that art conducted through this Hell,'
He said to me, 'recall me, if thou canst;
Thyself wast made before I was unmade.'
And I to him: 'The anguish which thou hast
Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,
So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.
But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful
A place art put, and in such punishment,
If some are greater, none is so displeasing.'
And he to me: 'Thy city, which is full
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Of envy so that now the sack runs over,
Held me within it in the life serene.
You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
For the pernicious sin of gluttony
I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.
And I, sad soul, am not the only one,
For all these suffer the like penalty
For the like sin;' and word no more spake he.
I answered him: 'Ciacco, thy wretchedness
Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come
The citizens of the divided city;
If any there be just; and the occasion
Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.'
And he to me: 'They, after long contention,
Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party
Will drive the other out with much offence.
Then afterwards behoves it this one fall
Within three suns, and rise again the other
By force of him who now is on the coast.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>High will it hold its forehead a long while,
Keeping the other under heavy burdens,
Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.
The just are two, and are not understood there;
Envy and Arrogance and Avarice
Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.'
Here ended he his tearful utterance;
And I to him: 'I wish thee still to teach me,
And make a gift to me of further speech.
Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,
And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,
Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;
For great desire constraineth me to learn
If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.'
And he: 'They are among the blacker souls;
A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;
If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.
But when thou art again in the sweet world,
I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>No more I tell thee and no more I answer.'
Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,
Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;
He fell therewith prone like the other blind.
And the Guide said to me: 'He ain't getting up,
Though apparently the bible says something
about the end of days, so maybe then,
I was never really much of a scholar,
but I think it mentioned the dead rising,
Or maybe that was just in Ghostbusters.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture
Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,
Touching a little on the future life.
Wherefore I said: 'Master, these torments here,
Will they increase after the mighty sentence,
Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?'
And he to me: 'Man do I look like a prohpet?
Whatever is gonig to happen is going to happen,
And I have no way of knowing which is which.
These folks are trapped here forever
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>They can't get into heaven, so who cares?
It's harsh, but that's how the chips fall.'
Round in a circle by that road we went,
Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;
We came unto the point where the descent is;
There we found Plutus the great enemy.
</div>
<h2>CANTO VII.</h2>
<div>'Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!'
Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;
And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,
Said, to encourage me: 'Don't wig out,
We are too macho for this jive turkey,
He can't stop us entering the danger zone.'
Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,
And said: 'Shut up you freakshow;
Why not eat yourself for a change?
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>We got a divine purpose, higher than Nachos;
The big man upstairs sent us so beat it,
We're soaring eagles, you are a slithering snake.'
Even as the sails inflated by the wind
Involved together fall when snaps the mast,
So fell the cruel monster to the earth.
Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,
Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore
Which all the woe of the universe insacks.
Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>New toils and sufferings as I beheld?
And why doth our transgression waste us so?
As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,
That breaks itself on that which it encounters,
So here the folk must dance their roundelay.
Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,
On one side and the other, with great howls,
Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.
They clashed together, and then at that point
Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Crying, 'Why keepest?' and, 'Why squanderest thou?'
Thus they returned along the lurid circle
On either hand unto the opposite point,
Shouting their shameful metre evermore.
Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about
Through his half-circle to another joust;
And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,
Exclaimed: 'My Master, now declare to me
What people these are, and if all were clerks,
These shaven crowns upon the left of us.'
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>And he to me: 'I'll be frank with you dog,
These were the dudes who loved money
And let's be clear, I love money too.
But these guys loved money too much,
And like, not so much in a kinky way either,
But instead they would hurt people to get money.
You might see some churchy folks here
Maybe even a pope or two, and learn:
Even a priest can be a huge dick.'
And I: 'My Master, among such as these
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>I ought forsooth to recognise some few,
Who were infected with these maladies.'
And he to me: 'I dunno man, it's sort of dark;
And their dim view of compassion while alive
Makes their forms sort of blurry.  It's weird.
So now they're stuck here forever;
Or until Electronic Arts publishes Dante's Inferno
And they get some cameos in World 4.
I really have no sympathy, neither should you,
They took from others so now their souls are taken;
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>There's not much else to say on that matter.
Let me ask you a question buddy,
What do you do with your money? Your wealth?
Are you stingy with it, or do you help others?
Just remember these guys, or maybe Jacob Marley,
Yeah that's right, I know some Dickens
Even literature can be Macho at times.'
'Master,' I said to him, 'now tell me also
What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,
That has the world's goods so within its clutches?'
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And he to me: 'Look idiot,
Are you not listening or just being dense?
Let me tell you from the beginning, then.
God made everything, obviously,
He made the sky, and the sun, and the stars,
He made the Macho Man and tasty Nachos,
And distributed these Nachos to all creation;
Like a generous dude at a soup kitchen
Where instead of soup they serve Nachos,
But then people wanted MORE NACHOS,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>And would fight over their cheesy goodness,
Warm globes dripping from chips.
So people would fight wars over these things
And that is greed, my macho-in-training,
I was trying to be poetical, it's a metaphor.
And you can't fight greed, because it's nature;
Greed controls the government and church
Money is what drives corruption.
But hey, this is super depressing;
Did you like films by a guy named Herzog?
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>I just the other day watched one.
I'm not one in general for art flicks,
They're just not my speed, but let me say,
I learned an astounding amount about rubber.
Also, are you hot?  It's pretty hot;
I get that this is part of the eternal torment thing
But you'd think that greed's domain would be cooler.
Like, coins are made of metal, and cool to touch;
But now I'm rambling, let us press forward
I... I just was getting a little bored.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>We crossed the circle to the other bank,
Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself
Along a gully that runs out of it.
The water was more sombre far than perse;
And we, in company with the dusky waves,
Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.
A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,
This tristful brooklet, when it has descended
Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.
And I, who stood intent upon beholding,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,
All of them naked and with angry look.
They smote each other not alone with hands,
But with the head and with the breast and feet,
Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.
Said the good Master: 'What you're looking at
Is those folks who were consumed with anger;
REAL anger, not like we pretend in the ring
Their anger is so blazing hot that even now
It makes the very water down there bubble.
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>They writhe and spin and boil themselves.
In this jacuzzi, they whine about their lot
They can't take the heat, and unfortunately,
They are not allowed to get out of the kitchen;
So they sing a sad song.
I don't know all the words, but it boils down to,
'Boy it's hot and we are sad, so sad, so sad.''
Thus we went circling round the filthy fen
A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,
With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.
</div>
<h2>CANTO VIII.</h2>
<div>I say, continuing, that long before
We to the foot of that high tower had come,
Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,
By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,
And from afar another answer them,
So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.
And, to the sea of all discernment turned,
I said: 'What sayeth this, and what respondeth
That other fire? and who are they that made it?'
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>And he to me: 'If you look out over the waves
I figure you'll see what's going on
If the view is clear, in any case.'
Cord never shot an arrow from itself
That sped away athwart the air so swift,
As I beheld a very little boat
Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,
Under the guidance of a single pilot,
Who shouted, 'Now art thou arrived, fell soul?'
'Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>For this once,' said my Lord; 'thou shalt not have us
Longer than in the passing of the slough.'
As he who listens to some great deceit
That has been done to him, and then resents it,
Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.
My Guide descended down into the boat,
And then he made me enter after him,
And only when I entered seemed it laden.
Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,
The antique prow goes on its way, dividing
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>More of the water than 'tis wont with others.
While we were running through the dead canal,
Uprose in front of me one full of mire,
And said, 'Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?'
And I to him: 'Although I come, I stay not;
But who art thou that hast become so squalid?'
'Thou seest that I am one who weeps,' he answered.
And I to him: 'With weeping and with wailing,
Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;
For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.'
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;
Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,
Saying, 'You stay in your place or I will end you.'
Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;
He kissed my face, and said: 'Disdainful soul,
Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.
That was an arrogant person in the world;
Goodness is none, that decks his memory;
So likewise here his shade is furious.
How many are esteemed great kings up there,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,
Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!'
And I: 'My Master, much should I be pleased,
If I could see him soused into this broth,
Before we issue forth out of the lake.'
And he to me: 'Just be patient man,
We'll get there soon enough, you're like a child;
Asking 'are we there yet' from the backseat.'
A little after that, I saw such havoc
Made of him by the people of the mire,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>That still I praise and thank my God for it.
They all were shouting, 'At Philippo Argenti!'
And that exasperate spirit Florentine
Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.
We left him there, and more of him I tell not;
But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,
Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.
And the good Master said: 'See that place?
Dis city here is called Dis, get me?
The people who live there are not macho.'
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And I: 'Its mosques already, Master, clearly
Within there in the valley I discern
Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire
They were.'  And he to me: 'You're in Hell,
And given that Hell is both full of and on fire,
That red stuff you see is... fire, idiot.'
Then we arrived within the moats profound,
That circumvallate that disconsolate city;
The walls appeared to me to be of iron.
Not without making first a circuit wide,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>We came unto a place where loud the pilot
Cried out to us, 'Debark, here is the entrance.'
More than a thousand at the gates I saw
Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily
Were saying, 'Who is this that without death
Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?'
And my sagacious Master made a sign
Of wishing secretly to speak with them.
A little then they quelled their great disdain,
And said: 'Come thou alone, and he begone
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Who has so boldly entered these dominions.
Let him return alone by his mad road;
Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,
Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.'
Think, Reader, if I was discomforted
At utterance of the accursed words;
For never to return here I believed.
'O my dear Guide, who more than seven times
Hast rendered me security, and drawn me
From imminent peril that before me stood,
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Do not desert me,' said I, 'thus undone;
And if the going farther be denied us,
Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.'
And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,
Said unto me: 'Don't worry, I got you.
God sent us so they can't refuse us.
So just sit tight, watch the Macho Magic,
Take a load off those barking dogs;
I won't abandon you even if you're annoying.'
So onward goes and there abandons me
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,
For No and Yes within my head contend.
I could not hear what he proposed to them;
But with them there he did not linger long,
Ere each within in rivalry ran back.
They closed the portals, those our adversaries,
On my Lord's breast, who had remained without
And turned to me with footsteps far between.
His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he
Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>'Who is it that has refused to let us in?'
And unto me: 'I'm really angry now,
But don't worry, I can still handle this,
Their defenses are basically worthless.
They're just acting tough, but it's no use;
There's more than one way to skin a cat,
And more than one way to enter into Dis.
Look around for a stick, or maybe a bomb;
We're going to knock these walls down,
And march over the corpses of these demons,
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>That is how the city shall be opened.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO IX.</h2>
<div>That hue which cowardice brought out on me,
Beholding my Conductor backward turn,
Sooner repressed within him his new colour.
He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,
Because the eye could not conduct him far
Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.
'We probably should win this fight,'
Began he; 'or else, uh. . .
Let's just not think about that!'
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning
He covered up with what came afterward,
That they were words quite different from the first;
But none the less his saying gave me fear,
Because I carried out the broken phrase,
Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.
'Into this bottom of the doleful conch
Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,
Which for its pain has only hope cut off?'
This question put I; and he answered me:
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>'Nobody really comes this way,
So honestly it's really hard to say.
A while back I was summoned here
By some shitty wizard named Eric,
Who necromancy'd me against my will.
Though I hadn't been dead for very long,
He sent me on a bogus quest for nachos,
literal nachos, not some catchphrase joke;
Down there into the lowest circle of all,
The furthest from heaven you can get.
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Anyway, that's where we're going.
The swamp that we're in now,
Is entirely surrounding the city,
Remember, the one we can't get into.'
And more he said, but not in mind I have it;
Because mine eye had altogether drawn me
Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,
Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen
The three infernal Furies stained with blood,
Who had the limbs of women and their mien,
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;
Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,
Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.
And he who well the handmaids of the Queen
Of everlasting lamentation knew,
Said unto me: 'Check out those bird-ladies.
On the left is one named Ozzy;
On the right we have one named Flea;
And in the middle Slash;' and then was silent.
Each one her breast was rending with her nails;
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,
That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.
'Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!'
All shouted looking down; 'in evil hour
Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!'
'Oh yeah, you know about Medusa right?
Just close your eyes, bumble around blindly,
Because if you see her it's game over, man.'
Thus said the Master; and he turned me round
Himself, and trusted not unto my hands
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>So far as not to blind me with his own.
O ye who have undistempered intellects,
Observe the doctrine that conceals itself
Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!
And now there came across the turbid waves
The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,
Because of which both of the margins trembled;
Not otherwise it was than of a wind
Impetuous on account of adverse heats,
That smites the forest, and, without restraint,
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;
Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,
And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.
Mine eyes he loosed, and said: 'Yo, look over there
that foamy bit down the river can you see?
Over there where it's super smokey.'
Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent
Across the water scatter all abroad,
Until each one is huddled in the earth.
More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Thus fleeing from before one who on foot
Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.
From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,
Waving his left hand oft in front of him,
And only with that anguish seemed he weary.
Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,
And to the Master turned; and he made sign
That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.
Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!
He reached the gate, and with a little rod
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>He opened it, for there was no resistance.
'Hey all you hated people who couldn't get into heaven!'
Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;
'What makes you act so arrogant?
Don't you know you should be humble,
Isn't bad behavior what placed you here?
Don't you ever learn that being bad is bad?
You know that struggling is pointless right?
It's literally impossible to escape from Hell,
So why not chill, shoot some hoops or something?'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Then he returned along the miry road,
And spake no word to us, but had the look
Of one whom other care constrains and goads
Than that of him who in his presence is;
And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,
After those holy words all confident.
Within we entered without any contest;
And I, who inclination had to see
What the condition such a fortress holds,
Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>And see on every hand an ample plain,
Full of distress and torment terrible.
Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,
Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,
That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,
The sepulchres make all the place uneven;
So likewise did they there on every side,
Saving that there the manner was more bitter;
For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,
By which they so intensely heated were,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>That iron more so asks not any art.
All of their coverings uplifted were,
And from them issued forth such dire laments,
Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.
And I: 'My Master, what are all those people
Who, having sepulture within those tombs,
Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?'
And he to me: 'Those are the Heresiarchs,
And their disciples, dressed in pink.
A bunch more are napping in the crypts.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>A lot of folks here spent their time sleeping;
It's awfully hot and it helps to pass the time.'
And when he to the right had turned, we passed
Between the torments and high parapets.
</div>
<h2>CANTO X.</h2>
<div>Now onward goes, along a narrow path
Between the torments and the city wall,
My Master, and I follow at his back.
'O power supreme, that through these impious circles
Turnest me,' I began, 'as pleases thee,
Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;
The people who are lying in these tombs,
Might they be seen? already are uplifted
The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.'
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>And he to me: 'Everything will close.
Remember the Book of Revelations?
The dead are going to rise someday.
The seas will churn, and turn to blood
Like some heavy metal album cover,
There's a dragon too, it's awesome;
But as for your question right now,
You'll see the answer soon enough,
And wish you hadn't asked at all.'
And I: 'Good Leader, I but keep concealed
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,
Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.'
'Buddy, we went through a flaming city.
You made it through alive, no mean feat.
So chill a bit, and see what is coming up.
I can tell by the way that you talk
That you and I share a fatherland,
and maybe I've razzed you a bit too much.'
Upon a sudden issued forth this sound
From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.
And unto me he said: 'What are you doing?
Look over there at Farinata the zombie;
Sticking out from the waist up.'
I had already fixed mine eyes on his,
And he uprose erect with breast and front
E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.
And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader
Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,
Exclaiming, 'Go talk to him dude!'
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb
Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,
Then asked of me, 'Who were thine ancestors?'
I, who desirous of obeying was,
Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;
Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.
Then said he: 'Fiercely adverse have they been
To me, and to my fathers, and my party;
So that two several times I scattered them.'
'If they were banished, they returned on all sides,'
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>I answered him, 'the first time and the second;
But yours have not acquired that art aright.'
Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered
Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;
I think that he had risen on his knees.
Round me he gazed, as if solicitude
He had to see if some one else were with me,
But after his suspicion was all spent,
Weeping, he said to me: 'If through this blind
Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?'
And I to him: 'I come not of myself;
He who is waiting yonder leads me here,
Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.'
His language and the mode of punishment
Already unto me had read his name;
On that account my answer was so full.
Up starting suddenly, he cried out: 'How
Saidst thou,--he had?  Is he not still alive?
Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?'
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>When he became aware of some delay,
Which I before my answer made, supine
He fell again, and forth appeared no more.
But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire
I had remained, did not his aspect change,
Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.
'And if,' continuing his first discourse,
'They have that art,' he said, 'not learned aright,
That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.
But fifty times shall not rekindled be
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,
Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;
And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,
Say why that people is so pitiless
Against my race in each one of its laws?'
Whence I to him: 'The slaughter and great carnage
Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause
Such orisons in our temple to be made.'
After his head he with a sigh had shaken,
'There I was not alone,' he said, 'nor surely
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Without a cause had with the others moved.
But there I was alone, where every one
Consented to the laying waste of Florence,
He who defended her with open face.'
'Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,'
I him entreated, 'solve for me that knot,
Which has entangled my conceptions here.
It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,
Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,
And in the present have another mode.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>'We see, like those who have imperfect sight,
The things,' he said, 'that distant are from us;
So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.
When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain
Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,
Not anything know we of your human state.
Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead
Will be our knowledge from the moment when
The portal of the future shall be closed.'
Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Said: 'Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,
That still his son is with the living joined.
And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,
Tell him I did it because I was thinking
Already of the error you have solved me.'
And now my Master was recalling me,
Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit
That he would tell me who was with him there.
He said: 'With more than a thousand here I lie;
Within here is the second Frederick,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.'
Thereon he hid himself; and I towards
The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting
Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.
He moved along; and afterward thus going,
He said to me, 'Why are you confused?'
And I in his inquiry satisfied him.
'Let your experience here help you,
against yourself,' that Sage commanded me,
'And now listen up;' and he raised his finger.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>'When we finally reach your hot mama
That lady so fine that the angels swoon,
From her you'll learn all about your own life.'
Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;
We left the wall, and went towards the middle,
Along a path that strikes into a valley,
Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XI.</h2>
<div>Upon the margin of a lofty bank
Which great rocks broken in a circle made,
We came upon a still more cruel throng;
And there, by reason of the horrible
Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,
We drew ourselves aside behind the cover
Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,
Which said: 'Pope Anastasius I hold,
Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.'
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>'Now's the time to take it slow,
It's not very macho, but so it goes
Otherwise we may fall and look silly.'
The Master thus; and unto him I said,
'Some compensation find, that the time pass not
Idly;' and he: 'You really know nothing.
Check out these rocks here, they're gnarly,'
Began he then to say, 'inside are three small circles,
Sort of like the circles that we're leaving now.
They're full of damned souls of course;
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>And soon enough you'll see for youself,
And hear their super annoying LAME-O whining.
They've done basically every bad thing,
You name it and they've done it probably,
They lie and cheat and steal and sing.
The ones up here in particular are the liars,
Only humans lie so God hates liars the most,
It's one of the least macho things you can do.
The first circle was the violent of course;
But lots of creatures can hit a dude,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Heck even I, the Nacho Man, have done so.
And God himself uses force on stuff,
Smiting a particularly sinful tree,
Hurling a lightning bolt and a crab.
You can die by violence, or kill,
Or do all sorts of gnarly things to a guy
Ruin, and arson, and straight-up punching;
Homicide, patricide, fratricide, and so forth,
Marauders, and freebooters, everything,
They're all condemned to one circle or another.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Heck you can even inflict violence on yourself
In more ways than one if you know what I mean
And that might get you punished as well
Basically never lay a hand on anybody
Without their consent, or permission,
Otherwise maybe you'll burn forever.
Violence can even be done to God,
Saying rude stuff about him, calling names,
Littering or messing up nature.
In fact, by some measure it can be said
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Literally any action is violent to somebody,
But liars do violence with words alone.
That is why those who commit fraud,
Those who decieve and hoodwink others,
Are probably folks you should not trust.
They have cut themselves off from the macho,
Nature abhors their cunning ways.
The second circle is similar of course,
Hypocrisy, flattery, and sweet wizards,
Falsification, theft, and puppyhaters,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.
They've forgotten things to love in life,
Nature's bounty, a plate of nachos,
All good things from which rad feelings flow.
But it is in this circle, the smallest part
Of the Universe, where Dis is located,
That the betrayers and backstabbers are.'
And I: 'My Master, clear enough proceeds
Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes
This cavern and the people who possess it.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,
Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,
And who encounter with such bitter tongues,
Wherefore are they inside of the red city
Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,
And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?'
And unto me he said: 'Come on bro,
Why do you keep asking these things?
Were you not listening to me at all?
Don't you have any memory whatsoever
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Of all the unethical things that exist
and which heaven itself hold as uncool?--
Incontinence, and Malice, and insane
Bestiality? and how Incontinence
Makes you smell bad, and makes a big mess?
If you think about it for a second,
And remember who are trapped in this place
Those doing penance for their misdeeds,
Surely you'll understand why they're apart
Why their sentences are slightly less painful
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>How Justice has seen to show a bit of mercy.'
'Praise the sun!  For it shines upon those,
Whom you claim to be confused by, no doubt
Having not even bothered to look behind us!
Once more a little backward turn thee,' said I,
'There where thou sayest that usury offends
Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.'
'Think about it,' he said, 'Use your head,
Consider the ways in which one might sin,
And how Nature might deal with you,
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>There are a few types of sins;
Did you ever have physics in school,
And looking through a lame-o textbook,
Determine that everything you knew
Was total bogus, entirely worthless;
Such that you just dropped the class?
Try and stir up that feeling
Only think about, I dunno, Eden,
The sort of sins that were commited;
And whether or not blame is assigned,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Or maybe like, read Paradise Lost?
It's written a few centuries after you die.
Anyway, we don't have all day,
We don't need to move slowly anymore,
So let's pick up the pace a bit, yes?
Let's do a sweet trick off this crag here.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XII.</h2>
<div>The place where to descend the bank we came
Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,
Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.
Such as that ruin is which in the flank
Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,
Either by earthquake or by failing stay,
For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,
Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,
Some path 'twould give to him who was above;
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Even such was the descent of that ravine,
And on the border of the broken chasm
The infamy of Crete was stretched along,
Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;
And when he us beheld, he bit himself,
Even as one whom anger racks within.
My Sage towards him shouted: 'Is it possible
That you think the Duke of Athens is here,
Who killed you right good long ago?
Get your ugly self out of here, loser.
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Else I say something rude about your sister
And then I'll point and laugh at you.'
As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment
In which he has received the mortal blow,
Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,
The Minotaur beheld I do the like;
And he, the wary, cried: 'Run to the passage;
While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend.'
Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge
Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.
Thoughtful I went; and he said: 'You're thinking
About how I totally owned that stupid bullman
And how he ran crying before my machoness.
Let me tell you this: the last time
I came through this part of Hell,
This bit hadn't collapsed yet.
And I saw the minotaur dressed up nicely
Leaving his day job in Dis, coming home
Ready to spend the evening with his family,
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>And I thought maybe he's just like us
Just doing his day job being an evil demon
And comes home to a loving household at night
But then I realize no that's stupid;
He's a crazy bullman with doofy cow horns
And basically nothing makes that not awful.
Anyway, look at that sweet river down there,
It's a river of blood! Super macho!
The folks swimming in it hurt other people.'
O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>That spurs us onward so in our short life,
And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!
I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,
As one which all the plain encompasses,
Conformable to what my Guide had said.
And between this and the embankment's foot
Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,
As in the world they used the chase to follow.
Beholding us descend, each one stood still,
And from the squadron three detached themselves,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>With bows and arrows in advance selected;
And from afar one cried: 'Unto what torment
Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?
Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.'
My Master said: 'We ain't telling you nothin'
We talk to Chrion and nobody but him.
Cry about if if you can't handle it.'
Then touched he me, and said: 'That guy is Nessus,
Who died for the lovely Dejanira,
And took some really gnarly revenge.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And over there through the blood-mist,
You can see Chiron; who trained Achilles
And Pholus who is known for his bad temper.
Thousands of demons stand around the river
Any time a soul tries to escape the blood
They plug him full of arrows! Ka-pow! Wham!'
Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;
Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch
Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.
After he had uncovered his great mouth,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>He said to his companions: 'Are you ware
That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?
Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.'
And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,
Where the two natures are together joined,
Replied: 'He's alive, it is true
And it is my job to take him through Hell.
This is no pleasure cruise let me tell you.
We're on a mission from God, as it were,
I've got this task direct rom upstairs;
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>So we're just going to keep on rolling.
But while I have your attention, let me ask
Given the macho nature of our mission,
And the fact that we have to get through,
Could you lend us one of your centaurs,
Who can let us ride on his back;
This guy isn't a ghost and can't float.'
Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,
And said to Nessus: 'Turn and do thou guide them,
And warn aside, if other band may meet you.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>We with our faithful escort onward moved
Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,
Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.
People I saw within up to the eyebrows,
And the great Centaur said: 'Tyrants are these,
Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.
Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here
Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius
Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.
That forehead there which has the hair so black
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,
Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,
Up in the world was by his stepson slain.'
Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,
'I have no idea what any of that meant.'
A little farther on the Centaur stopped
Above a folk, who far down as the throat
Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.
A shade he showed us on one side alone,
Saying: 'He cleft asunder in God's bosom
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.'
Then people saw I, who from out the river
Lifted their heads and also all the chest;
And many among these I recognised.
Thus ever more and more grew shallower
That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;
And there across the moat our passage was.
'Even as thou here upon this side beholdest
The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,'
The Centaur said, 'I wish thee to believe
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>That on this other more and more declines
Its bed, until it reunites itself
Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.
Justice divine, upon this side, is goading
That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,
And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks
The tears which with the boiling it unseals
In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,
Who made upon the highways so much war.'
Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XIII.</h2>
<div>Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,
When we had put ourselves within a wood,
That was not marked by any path whatever.
Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,
Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,
Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.
Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,
Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold
'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,
Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,
With sad announcement of impending doom;
Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,
And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;
They make laments upon the wondrous trees.
And the good Master: 'Before we go further,
I want to let you know we're in the second round,'
Thus he began to say, 'and will be, until
We get to the Beach of Gross Sand Crud;
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>As we go, look to your sides and you'll see
The proof, if you doubt my macho words.'
I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,
And person none beheld I who might make them,
Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.
I think he thought that I perhaps might think
So many voices issued through those trunks
From people who concealed themselves from us;
Therefore the Master said: 'Why not break off
A little bit of a tree to satisfy yourself?
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Plants don't feel pain, right?  Probably.'
Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,
And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;
And the trunk cried, 'Why dost thou mangle me?'
After it had become embrowned with blood,
It recommenced its cry: 'Why dost thou rend me?
Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?
Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;
Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,
Even if the souls of serpents we had been.'
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>As out of a green brand, that is on fire
At one of the ends, and from the other drips
And hisses with the wind that is escaping;
So from that splinter issued forth together
Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip
Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.
'Oh man, you fell for it, what a dope!'
My Sage made answer, 'Hey tree buddy,
This joker has no idea where he is,
And so I decided to prank him at your expense;
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Sorry 'bout that, but it was SO MACHO!
Why don't you tell him who you are?
That way when he leaves for the living world,
Maybe he can tell your ex-wife or something
That he saw you here, and she'll laugh.'
And the trunk said: 'So thy sweet words allure me,
I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,
That I a little to discourse am tempted.
I am the one who both keys had in keeping
Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>So softly in unlocking and in locking,
That from his secrets most men I withheld;
Fidelity I bore the glorious office
So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.
The courtesan who never from the dwelling
Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,
Death universal and the vice of courts,
Inflamed against me all the other minds,
And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,
That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,
Thinking by dying to escape disdain,
Made me unjust against myself, the just.
I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,
Do swear to you that never broke I faith
Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;
And to the world if one of you return,
Let him my memory comfort, which is lying
Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.'
Waited awhile, and then: 'If you want to know more,'
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>The Poet said to me, 'don't waste time,
We don't have all day so ask him now.'
Whence I to him: 'Do thou again inquire
Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;
For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.'
Therefore he recommenced: 'So may the man
Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,
Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased
To tell us in what way the soul is bound
Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>If any from such members e'er is freed.'
Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward
The wind was into such a voice converted:
'With brevity shall be replied to you.
When the exasperated soul abandons
The body whence it rent itself away,
Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.
It falls into the forest, and no part
Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,
There like a grain of spelt it germinates.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;
The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,
Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.
Like others for our spoils shall we return;
But not that any one may them revest,
For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.
Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal
Forest our bodies shall suspended be,
Each to the thorn of his molested shade.'
We were attentive still unto the trunk,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,
When by a tumult we were overtaken,
In the same way as he is who perceives
The boar and chase approaching to his stand,
Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;
And two behold! upon our left-hand side,
Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,
That of the forest, every fan they broke.
He who was in advance: 'Now help, Death, help!'
And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Was shouting: 'Lano, were not so alert
Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!'
And then, perchance because his breath was failing,
He grouped himself together with a bush.
Behind them was the forest full of black
She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot
As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.
On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,
And him they lacerated piece by piece,
Thereafter bore away those aching members.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,
And led me to the bush, that all in vain
Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.
'O Jacopo,' it said, 'of Sant' Andrea,
What helped it thee of me to make a screen?
What blame have I in thy nefarious life?'
When near him had the Master stayed his steps,
He said: 'Hey Bush Buddy, tell us a story
What was your life like?  We're curious.'
And he to us: 'O souls, that hither come
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>To look upon the shameful massacre
That has so rent away from me my leaves,
Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;
I of that city was which to the Baptist
Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this
Forever with his art will make it sad.
And were it not that on the pass of Arno
Some glimpses of him are remaining still,
Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it
Upon the ashes left by Attila,
<aside class="versenum">150</aside>In vain had caused their labour to be done.
Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XIV.</h2>
<div>Because the charity of my native place
Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,
And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.
Then came we to the confine, where disparted
The second round is from the third, and where
A horrible form of Justice is beheld.
Clearly to manifest these novel things,
I say that we arrived upon a plain,
Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>The dolorous forest is a garland to it
All round about, as the sad moat to that;
There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.
The soil was of an arid and thick sand,
Not of another fashion made than that
Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.
Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou
By each one to be dreaded, who doth read
That which was manifest unto mine eyes!
Of naked souls beheld I many herds,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Who all were weeping very miserably,
And over them seemed set a law diverse.
Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;
And some were sitting all drawn up together,
And others went about continually.
Those who were going round were far the more,
And those were less who lay down to their torment,
But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.
O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,
Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>As of the snow on Alp without a wind.
As Alexander, in those torrid parts
Of India, beheld upon his host
Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.
Whence he provided with his phalanxes
To trample down the soil, because the vapour
Better extinguished was while it was single;
Thus was descending the eternal heat,
Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder
Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Without repose forever was the dance
Of miserable hands, now there, now here,
Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.
'Master,' began I, 'thou who overcomest
All things except the demons dire, that issued
Against us at the entrance of the gate,
Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not
The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,
So that the rain seems not to ripen him?'
And he himself, who had become aware
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>That I was questioning my Guide about him,
Cried: 'Such as I was living, am I, dead.
If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom
He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,
Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,
And if he wearied out by turns the others
In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,
Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'
Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,
And shot his bolts at me with all his might,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.'
Then did my Leader speak with such great force,
That I had never heard him speak so loud:
'Yo Capaneus, aren't you aware that
Your arrogance increases your punishment;?
The only thing making you miserable,
Is yourself.  Chill out bro!'
Then he turned round to me with better lip,
Saying: 'This un-macho rage man here
Was one of seven kings who beseged Thebes
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And also he seems to hate God for some reason;
The only reason he's here is his doing
If he calmed down he could walk on out.
Now follow me, but step lightly here
Don't let your feet touch the grody sand,
Stay close to the woods, understand?'
Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes
Forth from the wood a little rivulet,
Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.
As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>The sinful women later share among them,
So downward through the sand it went its way.
The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,
Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;
Whence I perceived that there the passage was.
'Out of everything we've seen so far
Since we began this hellish vacation
Has been pretty gnarly, you'll agree
But feast your eyes on this fire-water
Nothing is as rad as this here river,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>With the flames dancing on the surface.'
These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him
That he would give me largess of the food,
For which he had given me largess of desire.
'Back on Earth there is this island,'
Said he thereafterward, 'It's called Crete,
And the king there kept his world boring.
On Crete there's this huge old mountain
There are streams and forests and nature stuff.
Nobody lives there, but it's pretty okay.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>The Greeks believed that a goddess gave birth
And hid her son on that island, which I guess
Makes sense because babies are loud and all.
I'm not really sure where I'm going with this
It doesn't have very much to do with the river,
But it somehow seemed like the right thing.
Say, did you know that some guy back on Earth,
Made a video game where I'm a dragon?
It's awesome!  I can breath fire and fly.
Did you bring any food with you at all?
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Ghosts can't really eat you understand,
But it's been so long since I snapped
Into a Slim Jim that I kinda was hoping
Maybe you had one in your pocket somewhere,
And could just pass it through me a bit
So that I can absorb some of the essence.
That's how ghosts eat, like this you see;
Watch 1995's 'Casper', it's in there.
Anyway, this river flows down through Hell.
Eventually it will go to the very bottom
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>But you'll see where, we're going there.'
And I to him: 'If so the present runnel
Doth take its rise in this way from our world,
Why only on this verge appears it to us?'
And he to me: 'You know that Hell is circular,
We've come a long way but not long enough,
There's still a long way yet to go,
We haven't made it quite to the end yet.
So if you've been surprised by the sights,
Let me say: You ain't seen nothing yet.'
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>And I again: 'Master, where shall be found
Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,
And sayest the other of this rain is made?'
'I said nothing of the sort, you buffoon!'
Replied he; 'but to answer your question,
If you look at the water you might know.
See the water there? That's the Lethe,
Sometimes the souls of the punished bathe
And forget why they're here.  It sucks.'
Then said he: 'Alright that's enough for now
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>Tourism time is over, we have a schedule;
Let's go this way, follow me across,
I want to get out of this stupid forest.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XV.</h2>
<div>Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,
And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,
From fire it saves the water and the dikes.
Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,
Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,
Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;
And as the Paduans along the Brenta,
To guard their villas and their villages,
Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>In such similitude had those been made,
Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,
Whoever he might be, the master made them.
Now were we from the forest so remote,
I could not have discovered where it was,
Even if backward I had turned myself,
When we a company of souls encountered,
Who came beside the dike, and every one
Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont
To eye each other under a new moon,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>And so towards us sharpened they their brows
As an old tailor at the needle's eye.
Thus scrutinised by such a family,
By some one I was recognised, who seized
My garment's hem, and cried out, 'What a marvel!'
And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,
On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,
That the scorched countenance prevented not
His recognition by my intellect;
And bowing down my face unto his own,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>I made reply, 'Are you here, Ser Brunetto?'
And he: 'May't not displease thee, O my son,
If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini
Backward return and let the trail go on.'
I said to him: 'With all my power I ask it;
And if you wish me to sit down with you,
I will, if he please, for I go with him.'
'O son,' he said, 'whoever of this herd
A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,
Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,
And afterward will I rejoin my band,
Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.'
I did not dare to go down from the road
Level to walk with him; but my head bowed
I held as one who goeth reverently.
And he began: 'What fortune or what fate
Before the last day leadeth thee down here?
And who is this that showeth thee the way?'
'Up there above us in the life serene,'
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>I answered him, 'I lost me in a valley,
Or ever yet my age had been completed.
But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;
This one appeared to me, returning thither,
And homeward leadeth me along this road.'
And he to me: 'If thou thy star do follow,
Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,
If well I judged in the life beautiful.
And if I had not died so prematurely,
Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>I would have given thee comfort in the work.
But that ungrateful and malignant people,
Which of old time from Fesole descended,
And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,
Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;
And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs
It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.
Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;
A people avaricious, envious, proud;
Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,
One party and the other shall be hungry
For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.
Their litter let the beasts of Fesole
Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,
If any still upon their dunghill rise,
In which may yet revive the consecrated
Seed of those Romans, who remained there when
The nest of such great malice it became.'
'If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,'
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Replied I to him, 'not yet would you be
In banishment from human nature placed;
For in my mind is fixed, and touches now
My heart the dear and good paternal image
Of you, when in the world from hour to hour
You taught me how a man becomes eternal;
And how much I am grateful, while I live
Behoves that in my language be discerned.
What you narrate of my career I write,
And keep it to be glossed with other text
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.
This much will I have manifest to you;
Provided that my conscience do not chide me,
For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.
Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;
Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around
As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.'
My Master thereupon on his right cheek
Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;
Then said: 'Man, what a downer!'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Nor speaking less on that account, I go
With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are
His most known and most eminent companions.
And he to me: 'To know of some is well;
Of others it were laudable to be silent,
For short would be the time for so much speech.
Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,
And men of letters great and of great fame,
In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.
Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there
If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,
That one, who by the Servant of the Servants
From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,
Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.
More would I say, but coming and discoursing
Can be no longer; for that I behold
New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.
A people comes with whom I may not be;
Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>In which I still live, and no more I ask.'
Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those
Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle
Across the plain; and seemed to be among them
The one who wins, and not the one who loses.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XVI.</h2>
<div>Now was I where was heard the reverberation
Of water falling into the next round,
Like to that humming which the beehives make,
When shadows three together started forth,
Running, from out a company that passed
Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.
Towards us came they, and each one cried out:
'Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest
To be some one of our depraved city.'
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,
Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!
It pains me still but to remember it.
Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;
He turned his face towards me, and 'Now wait,'
He said; 'We need to be nice to these guys.
If it weren't for the fact that we're in Hell
Which is inherently a bad place to be
I'd say that they're swell dudes really.'
As soon as we stood still, they recommenced
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>The old refrain, and when they overtook us,
Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.
As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,
Watching for their advantage and their hold,
Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,
Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage
Direct to me, so that in opposite wise
His neck and feet continual journey made.
And, 'If the misery of this soft place
Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,'
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Began one, 'and our aspect black and blistered,
Let the renown of us thy mind incline
To tell us who thou art, who thus securely
Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.
He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,
Naked and skinless though he now may go,
Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;
He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;
His name was Guidoguerra, and in life
Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>The other, who close by me treads the sand,
Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame
Above there in the world should welcome be.
And I, who with them on the cross am placed,
Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly
My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.'
Could I have been protected from the fire,
Below I should have thrown myself among them,
And think the Teacher would have suffered it;
But as I should have burned and baked myself,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>My terror overmastered my good will,
Which made me greedy of embracing them.
Then I began: 'Sorrow and not disdain
Did your condition fix within me so,
That tardily it wholly is stripped off,
As soon as this my Lord said unto me
Words, on account of which I thought within me
That people such as you are were approaching.
I of your city am; and evermore
Your labours and your honourable names
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>I with affection have retraced and heard.
I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits
Promised to me by the veracious Leader;
But to the centre first I needs must plunge.'
'So may the soul for a long while conduct
Those limbs of thine,' did he make answer then,
'And so may thy renown shine after thee,
Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell
Within our city, as they used to do,
Or if they wholly have gone out of it;
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment
With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,
Doth greatly mortify us with his words.'
'The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,
Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,
Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!'
In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;
And the three, taking that for my reply,
Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.
'If other times so little it doth cost thee,'
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Replied they all, 'to satisfy another,
Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!
Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,
And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,
When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'
See that thou speak of us unto the people.'
Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight
It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.
Not an Amen could possibly be said
So rapidly as they had disappeared;
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.
I followed him, and little had we gone,
Before the sound of water was so near us,
That speaking we should hardly have been heard.
Even as that stream which holdeth its own course
The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,
Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,
Which is above called Acquacheta, ere
It down descendeth into its low bed,
And at Forli is vacant of that name,
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Reverberates there above San Benedetto
From Alps, by falling at a single leap,
Where for a thousand there were room enough;
Thus downward from a bank precipitate,
We found resounding that dark-tinted water,
So that it soon the ear would have offended.
I had a cord around about me girt,
And therewithal I whilom had designed
To take the panther with the painted skin.
After I this had all from me unloosed,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>As my Conductor had commanded me,
I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,
Whereat he turned himself to the right side,
And at a little distance from the verge,
He cast it down into that deep abyss.
'It must needs be some novelty respond,'
I said within myself, 'to the new signal
The Master with his eye is following so.'
Ah me! how very cautious men should be
With those who not alone behold the act,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!
He said to me: 'Soon what I'm waiting for
Will show up here, and your curiosity
Might be satisfied, for a while.'
Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,
A man should close his lips as far as may be,
Because without his fault it causes shame;
But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes
Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,
So may they not be void of lasting favour,
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere
I saw a figure swimming upward come,
Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,
Even as he returns who goeth down
Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled
Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,
Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XVII.</h2>
<div>'Look at that super macho monster down there!
He shatters mountains and breaks city walls!
Check out his power, and be awed!'
Thus unto me my Guide began to say,
And beckoned him that he should come to shore,
Near to the confine of the trodden marble;
And that uncleanly image of deceit
Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,
But on the border did not drag its tail.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>The face was as the face of a just man,
Its semblance outwardly was so benign,
And of a serpent all the trunk beside.
Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;
The back, and breast, and both the sides it had
Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.
With colours more, groundwork or broidery
Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,
Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.
As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>That part are in the water, part on land;
And as among the guzzling Germans there,
The beaver plants himself to wage his war;
So that vile monster lay upon the border,
Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.
His tail was wholly quivering in the void,
Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,
That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.
The Guide said: 'We should avoid it.
Despite my macho strength and nacho power
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>He is one dude that I don't want to fight.'
We therefore on the right side descended,
And made ten steps upon the outer verge,
Completely to avoid the sand and flame;
And after we are come to him, I see
A little farther off upon the sand
A people sitting near the hollow place.
Then said to me the Master: 'It'll improve
Your experience of Hell immensely,
If you go ask them what their deal is.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>This is not space, but for them, it's the place;
While you do that I'm going to sunbathe,
In this Sahara that is Macho Madness.'
Thus farther still upon the outermost
Head of that seventh circle all alone
I went, where sat the melancholy folk.
Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;
This way, that way, they helped them with their hands
Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.
Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when
By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.
When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces
Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,
Not one of them I knew; but I perceived
That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,
Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;
And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.
And as I gazing round me come among them,
Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>That had the face and posture of a lion.
Proceeding then the current of my sight,
Another of them saw I, red as blood,
Display a goose more white than butter is.
And one, who with an azure sow and gravid
Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,
Said unto me: 'What dost thou in this moat?
Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,
Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,
Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;
Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,
Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,
He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;''
Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust
His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.
And fearing lest my longer stay might vex
Him who had warned me not to tarry long,
Backward I turned me from those weary souls.
I found my Guide, who had already mounted
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Upon the back of that wild animal,
And said to me: 'Now don't be a wuss.
It's time to descend some stairs, get hype!
You ride up front and me in back,
So that you don't get hurt by the tail.'
Such as he is who has so near the ague
Of quartan that his nails are blue already,
And trembles all, but looking at the shade;
Even such became I at those proffered words;
But shame in me his menaces produced,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Which maketh servant strong before good master.
I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;
I wished to say, and yet the voice came not
As I believed, 'Take heed that thou embrace me.'
But he, who other times had rescued me
In other peril, soon as I had mounted,
Within his arms encircled and sustained me,
And said: 'Giddyup hoss! Go forth;
It's not every day you carry the Macho Man;
Think of the story you can tell your friends.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,
Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;
And when he wholly felt himself afloat,
There where his breast had been he turned his tail,
And that extended like an eel he moved,
And with his paws drew to himself the air.
A greater fear I do not think there was
What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,
Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;
Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,
His father crying, 'An ill way thou takest!'
Than was my own, when I perceived myself
On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished
The sight of everything but of the monster.
Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;
Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only
By wind upon my face and from below.
I heard already on the right the whirlpool
Making a horrible crashing under us;
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.
Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;
Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,
Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.
I saw then, for before I had not seen it,
The turning and descending, by great horrors
That were approaching upon divers sides.
As falcon who has long been on the wing,
Who, without seeing either lure or bird,
Maketh the falconer say, 'Ah me, thou stoopest,'
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,
Thorough a hundred circles, and alights
Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;
Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,
Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,
And being disencumbered of our persons,
He sped away as arrow from the string.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XVIII.</h2>
<div>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,
Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,
As is the circle that around it turns.
Right in the middle of the field malign
There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,
Of which its place the structure will recount.
Round, then, is that enclosure which remains
Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,
And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>As where for the protection of the walls
Many and many moats surround the castles,
The part in which they are a figure forms,
Just such an image those presented there;
And as about such strongholds from their gates
Unto the outer bank are little bridges,
So from the precipice's base did crags
Project, which intersected dikes and moats,
Unto the well that truncates and collects them.
Within this place, down shaken from the back
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet
Held to the left, and I moved on behind.
Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,
New torments, and new wielders of the lash,
Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.
Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;
This side the middle came they facing us,
Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;
Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,
The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;
For all upon one side towards the Castle
Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;
On the other side they go towards the Mountain.
This side and that, along the livid stone
Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,
Who cruelly were beating them behind.
Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs
At the first blows! and sooth not any one
The second waited for, nor for the third.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>While I was going on, mine eyes by one
Encountered were; and straight I said: 'Already
With sight of this one I am not unfed.'
Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,
And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,
And to my going somewhat back assented;
And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,
Lowering his face, but little it availed him;
For said I: 'Thou that castest down thine eyes,
If false are not the features which thou bearest,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;
But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?'
And he to me: 'Unwillingly I tell it;
But forces me thine utterance distinct,
Which makes me recollect the ancient world.
I was the one who the fair Ghisola
Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,
Howe'er the shameless story may be told.
Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;
Nay, rather is this place so full of them,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>That not so many tongues to-day are taught
'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'
And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,
Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.'
While speaking in this manner, with his scourge
A demon smote him, and said: 'Get thee gone
Pander, there are no women here for coin.'
I joined myself again unto mine Escort;
Thereafterward with footsteps few we came
To where a crag projected from the bank.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>This very easily did we ascend,
And turning to the right along its ridge,
From those eternal circles we departed.
When we were there, where it is hollowed out
Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,
The Guide said: 'Wait and look at them,
Those unhip cats who are born evil,
Those whom we have not seen as of yet,
Because they've been following us.'
From the old bridge we looked upon the train
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,
And which the scourges in like manner smite.
And the good Master, without my inquiring,
Said to me: 'Look at the tall one there,
Despite his pain he's standing up tall;
See how macho he remains in its face!
That's Jason, whom you've heard of maybe?
He did some pretty despicable stuff.
I honestly never read Greek myths
So I'm sort of in the dark about this.
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>You'll have to do the reading yourself.
Instead, why don't you go bother him?
Ask him about his wife and kids,
And if he ever was a liar to them.
I do know he had a cool boat called the Argo;
I heard he went searching for some mutton,
But then discovered gold was inedible.
Seems like you could learn a lot from him;
About how to be a jerk to women and kids
You know, if you weren't already.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>We were already where the narrow path
Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms
Of that a buttress for another arch.
Thence we heard people, who are making moan
In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,
And with their palms beating upon themselves
The margins were incrusted with a mould
By exhalation from below, that sticks there,
And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.
The bottom is so deep, no place suffices
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>To give us sight of it, without ascending
The arch's back, where most the crag impends.
Thither we came, and thence down in the moat
I saw a people smothered in a filth
That out of human privies seemed to flow;
And whilst below there with mine eye I search,
I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,
It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.
He screamed to me: 'Wherefore art thou so eager
To look at me more than the other foul ones?'
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>And I to him: 'Because, if I remember,
I have already seen thee with dry hair,
And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;
Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.'
And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:
'The flatteries have submerged me here below,
Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.'
Then said to me the Guide: 'See that thou thrust
Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,
That with thine eyes thou well the face attain
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,
Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,
And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.
Thais the harlot is it, who replied
Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I
Great gratitude from thee?'--'Nay, marvellous;'
And herewith let our sight be satisfied.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XIX.</h2>
<div>O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,
Ye who the things of God, which ought to be
The brides of holiness, rapaciously
For silver and for gold do prostitute,
Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,
Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.
We had already on the following tomb
Ascended to that portion of the crag
Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest
In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,
And with what justice doth thy power distribute!
I saw upon the sides and on the bottom
The livid stone with perforations filled,
All of one size, and every one was round.
To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater
Than those that in my beautiful Saint John
Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,
And one of which, not many years ago,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;
Be this a seal all men to undeceive.
Out of the mouth of each one there protruded
The feet of a transgressor, and the legs
Up to the calf, the rest within remained.
In all of them the soles were both on fire;
Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,
They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.
Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont
To move upon the outer surface only,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>So likewise was it there from heel to point.
'Master, who is that one who writhes himself,
More than his other comrades quivering,'
I said, 'and whom a redder flame is sucking?'
And he to me: 'If you follow me a little bit,
Down this bank to where that cat is sitting,
He will tell you himself his sorry story.'
And I: 'What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;
Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not
From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.'
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;
We turned, and on the left-hand side descended
Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.
And the good Master yet from off his haunch
Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me
Of him who so lamented with his shanks.
'Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,
O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,'
To say began I, 'if thou canst, speak out.'
I stood even as the friar who is confessing
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,
Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.
And he cried out: 'Dost thou stand there already,
Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?
By many years the record lied to me.
Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,
For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud
The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?'
Such I became, as people are who stand,
Not comprehending what is answered them,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.
Then said Macho Man: 'Quick-like, tell him
'That's not me, I'm a different guy!''
And I replied as was imposed on me.
Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,
Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation
Said to me: 'Then what wantest thou of me?
If who I am thou carest so much to know,
That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,
Know that I vested was with the great mantle;
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And truly was I son of the She-bear,
So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth
Above, and here myself, I pocketed.
Beneath my head the others are dragged down
Who have preceded me in simony,
Flattened along the fissure of the rock.
Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever
That one shall come who I believed thou wast,
What time the sudden question I proposed.
But longer I my feet already toast,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>And here have been in this way upside down,
Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;
For after him shall come of fouler deed
From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,
Such as befits to cover him and me.
New Jason will he be, of whom we read
In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,
So he who governs France shall be to this one.'
I do not know if I were here too bold,
That him I answered only in this metre:
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>'I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure
Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,
Before he put the keys into his keeping?
Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'
Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias
Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen
Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.
Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,
And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,
Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>And were it not that still forbids it me
The reverence for the keys superlative
Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,
I would make use of words more grievous still;
Because your avarice afflicts the world,
Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.
The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,
When she who sitteth upon many waters
To fornicate with kings by him was seen;
The same who with the seven heads was born,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>And power and strength from the ten horns received,
So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.
Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;
And from the idolater how differ ye,
Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?
Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,
Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower
Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!'
And while I sang to him such notes as these,
Either that anger or that conscience stung him,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>He struggled violently with both his feet.
I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,
With such contented lip he listened ever
Unto the sound of the true words expressed.
Therefore with both his arms he took me up,
And when he had me all upon his breast,
Remounted by the way where he descended.
Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;
But bore me to the summit of the arch
Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>There tenderly he laid his burden down,
Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,
That would have been hard passage for the goats:
Thence was unveiled to me another valley.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XX.</h2>
<div>Of a new pain behoves me to make verses
And give material to the twentieth canto
Of the first song, which is of the submerged.
I was already thoroughly disposed
To peer down into the uncovered depth,
Which bathed itself with tears of agony;
And people saw I through the circular valley,
Silent and weeping, coming at the pace
Which in this world the Litanies assume.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>As lower down my sight descended on them,
Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted
From chin to the beginning of the chest;
For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned,
And backward it behoved them to advance,
As to look forward had been taken from them.
Perchance indeed by violence of palsy
Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;
But I ne'er saw it, nor believe it can be.
As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>From this thy reading, think now for thyself
How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,
When our own image near me I beheld
Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes
Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.
Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak
Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said
To me: 'What are you crying for?
Are you tired?  Is it your bedtime?
It's been a big day for you I know.
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>You must be tired and not even know it.
Let me tell you a bedtime story then
To pass the time while we stride forward;
Our macho hair swirling in the breeze.
Once upon a time there was a warrior
Sarnath was his name, from Monqurt
He was a true knight, macho even as me.
When he was young he traveled far
Seeking the best challengers and champions
Besting them all in one-on-one rumbles.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Eventually he came to the land of the Church,
That great cathedral of Amour Lardo,
Where the Cellulite Pope held his court.
Sarnath did not know about religion
In his land there was no church at all,
And of course this world was not our own.
This Nacho Man of old was truly wowed,
The music of the priests blew him away
And the pontiff himself was noble and kind.
For a long time he lived at the court
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Aiding young paladins in their training
Serving as armsmaster for the holy army.
Until finally he took oaths himself,
Not those to be a clergyman, oh no,
But to serve as the shield of the church.
At this time an evil nation to the north,
Wicked and envious of the church's wealth;
Invaded and tried to stamp out the faith.
It was Sarnath who held the line,
Alongside his four most promising pupils,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Who ever after bore the title 'Hounds'.
Their names are famous today
They were Gleeok and Ragnasaurth
Ilthor and strongest of all Thorgan.
With their master they stemmed the tide,
These five alone against a legion of foes
Sheer numbers could not overcome their might.
Yet as the battle appeared to be won,
A single arrow struck Sarnath in the thigh
Fast-acting poison turned his blood cold.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>Gasping for air in his final minutes,
Sarnath passed his title on to Thorgan,
Appointing him leader of the Church's army.
Thus ended the story of the hero Sarnath
And where his spirit went I cannot say,
In that world things aren't as simple.
If you don't understand this story,
Don't sweat it, I'm just killing time.
It's actually not that great a story.
And sorry if my speech has become formal
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>During the telling of this particular tale,
I'm just trying to relate it I heard it.
Some guy named Pablo told it to me
When we were lifting at the gym last week,
And I guess it has kind of stuck with me.
Anyway, hopefully this happy tale
Has gotten you to stop crying,
or at least made you fall asleep;
Either way it's the same to me, after all,
We're going to have to keep going eventually
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Unlike you I have all the time in the world.
Say, have I ever tell you the cheese joke?
You know, the one with the goat and the spoon?
Where they end up at the sanitation plant?
Well it's too long to tell now,
There aren't many lines left in this Canto,
But remind me in Canto XXXIV, it's great.
A real knee-slapper let me tell you,
The sort of joke you'll tell your grandkids
Years from now as you munch on a Slim Jim.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>And I: 'My Master, thy discourses are
To me so certain, and so take my faith,
That unto me the rest would be spent coals.
But tell me of the people who are passing,
If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,
For only unto that my mind reverts.'
Then said he to me: 'Normally I'd tell you
But I've just spent a lot of time talking
And even ghosts get sore throats, you know.
I know that here there's like six more stanzas
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>And that if I stuck on-script I'd give them all
But honestly I'm just not feeling it right now.
So I'm going to take matters into my own hands
My MACHO hands; my NACHO hands, as they were.
And end this particular canto early.
I hope you don't hold it against me,
The next one is more interesting anyway
So let's just hurry along to it shall we?
Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXI.</h2>
<div>From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things
Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,
We came along, and held the summit, when
We halted to behold another fissure
Of Malebolge and other vain laments;
And I beheld it marvellously dark.
As in the Arsenal of the Venetians
Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch
To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof
One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks
The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;
One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,
This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,
Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;
Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,
Was boiling down below there a dense pitch
Which upon every side the bank belimed.
I saw it, but I did not see within it
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,
And all swell up and resubside compressed.
The while below there fixedly I gazed,
My Leader, crying out: 'Watch out!'
Drew me unto himself from where I stood.
Then I turned round, as one who is impatient
To see what it behoves him to escape,
And whom a sudden terror doth unman,
Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;
And I beheld behind us a black devil,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Running along upon the crag, approach.
Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!
And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,
With open wings and light upon his feet!
His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,
A sinner did encumber with both haunches,
And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.
From off our bridge, he said: 'O Malebranche,
Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;
Plunge him beneath, for I return for others
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.
All there are barrators, except Bonturo;
No into Yes for money there is changed.'
He hurled him down, and over the hard crag
Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened
In so much hurry to pursue a thief.
The other sank, and rose again face downward;
But the demons, under cover of the bridge,
Cried: 'Here the Santo Volto has no place!
Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,
Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.'
They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;
They said: 'It here behoves thee to dance covered,
That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.'
Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make
Immerse into the middle of the caldron
The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.
Said the good Master to me: 'You gotta hide,
So duck down behind this rock face
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>And they will not be able to see you;
Don't worry about what happesn to me,
None may withstand the Macho Man unleashed,
I've handled these demons many times.'
Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,
And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,
Need was for him to have a steadfast front.
With the same fury, and the same uproar,
As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,
Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>They issued from beneath the little bridge,
And turned against him all their grappling-irons;
But he cried out: 'Step back idiots!
Do you remember what happened last time,
When I was strolling through on vacation,
And you tried to grab me and paid the price?'
They all cried out: 'Let Malacoda go;'
Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,
And he came to him, saying: 'What avails it?'
'How now, Malacoda? Up for another round?
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>I hope your tail is healed.' my Master said,
'There's a reason your name is evil tail,
But what evil can you do if it breaks again?
Why not let me pass, and spare your body
Unless you're crusing for a bruising.'
Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,
That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,
And to the others said: 'Now strike him not.'
And unto me my Guide: 'O thou, who sittest
Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Securely now return to me again.'
Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;
And all the devils forward thrust themselves,
So that I feared they would not keep their compact.
And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers
Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,
Seeing themselves among so many foes.
Close did I press myself with all my person
Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes
From off their countenance, which was not good.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>They lowered their rakes, and 'Wilt thou have me hit him,'
They said to one another, 'on the rump?'
And answered: 'Yes; see that thou nick him with it.'
But the same demon who was holding parley
With my Conductor turned him very quickly,
And said: 'Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;'
Then said to us: 'You can no farther go
Forward upon this crag, because is lying
All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.
And if it still doth please you to go onward,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Pursue your way along upon this rock;
Near is another crag that yields a path.
Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,
One thousand and two hundred sixty-six
Years were complete, that here the way was broken.
I send in that direction some of mine
To see if any one doth air himself;
Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.
Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,'
Began he to cry out, 'and thou, Cagnazzo;
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.
Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,
And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,
And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;
Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;
Let these be safe as far as the next crag,
That all unbroken passes o'er the dens.'
'O me! what is it, Master, that I see?
Pray let us go,' I said, 'without an escort,
If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,
Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,
And with their brows are threatening woe to us?'
And he to me: 'There's no need to fear now;
They just want to regain their lost pride,
Gnashing their teeth to shore up their image.'
Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;
But first had each one thrust his tongue between
His teeth towards their leader for a signal;
And he had made a trumpet of his rump.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXII.</h2>
<div>I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,
Begin the storming, and their muster make,
And sometimes starting off for their escape;
Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,
O Aretines, and foragers go forth,
Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,
Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,
With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,
And with our own, and with outlandish things,
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth
Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,
Nor ship by any sign of land or star.
We went upon our way with the ten demons;
Ah, savage company! but in the church
With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!
Ever upon the pitch was my intent,
To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,
And of the people who therein were burned.
Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>To mariners by arching of the back,
That they should counsel take to save their vessel,
Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,
One of the sinners would display his back,
And in less time conceal it than it lightens.
As on the brink of water in a ditch
The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,
So that they hide their feet and other bulk,
So upon every side the sinners stood;
But ever as Barbariccia near them came,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.
I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,
One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass
One frog remains, and down another dives;
And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,
Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,
And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.
I knew, before, the names of all of them,
So had I noted them when they were chosen,
And when they called each other, listened how.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>'O Rubicante, see that thou do lay
Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,'
Cried all together the accursed ones.
And I: 'My Master, see to it, if thou canst,
That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,
Thus come into his adversaries' hands.'
Near to the side of him my Leader drew,
Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:
'I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;
My mother placed me servant to a lord,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>For she had borne me to a ribald knave,
Destroyer of himself and of his things.
Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;
I set me there to practise barratry,
For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.'
And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,
On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,
Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.
Among malicious cats the mouse had come;
But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>And said: 'Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.'
And to my Master he turned round his head;
'Ask him again,' he said, 'and just maybe
You've noticed I always tell you that.'
The Guide: 'Now tell us of the others here;
Are there any who are worthing hearing about?
Best gnarly story?'  And he: 'I separated
Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;
Would that I still were covered up with him,
For I should fear not either claw nor hook!'
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And Libicocco: 'We have borne too much;'
And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,
So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.
Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him
Down at the legs; whence their Decurion
Turned round and round about with evil look.
When they again somewhat were pacified,
Of him, who still was looking at his wound,
Demanded my Conductor without stay:
'Wow who was that guy?  I don't know him.
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Also you might want to get that looked at.'
And he replied: 'It was the Friar Gomita,
He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,
Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,
And dealt so with them each exults thereat;
Money he took, and let them smoothly off,
As he says; and in other offices
A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.
Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche
Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.
O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;
Still farther would I speak, but am afraid
Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.'
And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,
Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,
Said: 'Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.'
'If you desire either to see or hear,'
The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,
'Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>But let the Malebranche cease a little,
So that these may not their revenges fear,
And I, down sitting in this very place,
For one that I am will make seven come,
When I shall whistle, as our custom is
To do whenever one of us comes out.'
Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,
Shaking his head, and said: 'Just hear the trick
Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!'
Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Responded: 'I by far too cunning am,
When I procure for mine a greater sadness.'
Alichin held not in, but running counter
Unto the rest, said to him: 'If thou dive,
I will not follow thee upon the gallop,
But I will beat my wings above the pitch;
The height be left, and be the bank a shield
To see if thou alone dost countervail us.'
O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!
Each to the other side his eyes averted;
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>He first, who most reluctant was to do it.
The Navarrese selected well his time;
Planted his feet on land, and in a moment
Leaped, and released himself from their design.
Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,
But he most who was cause of the defeat;
Therefore he moved, and cried: 'Thou art o'ertakern.'
But little it availed, for wings could not
Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,
And, flying, upward he his breast directed;
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden
Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,
And upward he returneth cross and weary.
Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina
Flying behind him followed close, desirous
The other should escape, to have a quarrel.
And when the barrator had disappeared,
He turned his talons upon his companion,
And grappled with him right above the moat.
But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>To clapperclaw him well; and both of them
Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.
A sudden intercessor was the heat;
But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,
To such degree they had their wings belimed.
Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia
Made four of them fly to the other side
With all their gaffs, and very speedily
This side and that they to their posts descended;
They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,
<aside class="versenum">150</aside>Who were already baked within the crust,
And in this manner busied did we leave them.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXIII.</h2>
<div>Silent, alone, and without company
We went, the one in front, the other after,
As go the Minor Friars along their way.
Upon the fable of Aesop was directed
My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,
Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;
For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike
Than this one is to that, if well we couple
End and beginning with a steadfast mind.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>And even as one thought from another springs,
So afterward from that was born another,
Which the first fear within me double made.
Thus did I ponder: 'These on our account
Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff
So great, that much I think it must annoy them.
If anger be engrafted on ill-will,
They will come after us more merciless
Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,'
I felt my hair stand all on end already
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>With terror, and stood backwardly intent,
When said I: 'Master, if thou hidest not
Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche
I am in dread; we have them now behind us;
I so imagine them, I already feel them.'
And he: 'Sometimes when I hear you speak,
I have no idea what you're saying at all
And so I imagine it's a hilarious joke.
Now, for example, you just said gibberish,
Which I interpreted as a very funny bit
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>About a rooster and a tractor-trailer.
Let's take this downward slope here
Step lively, macho men don't lose balance,
Nothing shall catch us on this path.'
Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,
When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,
Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.
My Leader on a sudden seized me up,
Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,
And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,
Having more care of him than of herself,
So that she clothes her only with a shift;
And downward from the top of the hard bank
Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,
That one side of the other Bolgia walls.
Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice
To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,
When nearest to the paddles it approaches,
As did my Master down along that border,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Bearing me with him on his breast away,
As his own son, and not as a companion.
Hardly the bed of the ravine below
His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill
Right over us; but he was not afraid;
For the high Providence, which had ordained
To place them ministers of the fifth moat,
The power of thence departing took from all.
A painted people there below we found,
Who went about with footsteps very slow,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.
They had on mantles with the hoods low down
Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut
That in Cologne they for the monks are made.
Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;
But inwardly all leaden and so heavy
That Frederick used to put them on of straw.
O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!
Again we turned us, still to the left hand
Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>But owing to the weight, that weary folk
Came on so tardily, that we were new
In company at each motion of the haunch.
Whence I unto my Leader: 'See thou find
Some one who may by deed or name be known,
And thus in going move thine eye about.'
And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,
Cried to us from behind: 'Stay ye your feet,
Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!
Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest.'
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: 'Wait,
And walk towards this weird duck slowly.'
I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste
Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;
But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.
When they came up, long with an eye askance
They scanned me without uttering a word.
Then to each other turned, and said together:
'He by the action of his throat seems living;
And if they dead are, by what privilege
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?'
Then said to me: 'Tuscan, who to the college
Of miserable hypocrites art come,
Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.'
And I to them: 'Born was I, and grew up
In the great town on the fair river of Arno,
And with the body am I've always had.
But who are ye, in whom there trickles down
Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?
And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>And one replied to me: 'These orange cloaks
Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights
Cause in this way their balances to creak.
Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;
I Catalano, and he Loderingo
Named, and together taken by thy city,
As the wont is to take one man alone,
For maintenance of its peace; and we were such
That still it is apparent round Gardingo.'
'O Friars,' began I, 'your iniquitous. . .'
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed
One crucified with three stakes on the ground.
When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,
Blowing into his beard with suspirations;
And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,
Said to me: 'This transfixed one, whom thou seest,
Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet
To put one man to torture for the people.
Crosswise and naked is he on the path,
As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;
And in like mode his father-in-law is punished
Within this moat, and the others of the council,
Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.'
And thereupon I saw the Macho Man marvel
O'er him who was extended on the cross
So vilely in eternal banishment.
Then he directed to the Friar this voice:
'We're not lost, but if we were,
Would you tell us if we were going wrong?
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>We're heading down this slope and it seems good,
And the nacho man needs no directions,
No map, but still, you'd let us know, right?'
Then he made answer: 'Nearer than thou hopest
There is a rock, that forth from the great circle
Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,
Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;
You will be able to mount up the ruin,
That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.'
The Leader stood awhile with head held high;
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>Then said: 'That guy's breath is the worst
I think he ate too many salt and vinegar chips.'
And the Friar: 'Many of the Devil's vices
Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,
That he's a liar and the father of lies.'
Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,
Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;
Whence from the heavy-laden I departed
After the prints of his beloved feet.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXIV.</h2>
<div>In that part of the youthful year wherein
The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,
And now the nights draw near to half the day,
What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground
The outward semblance of her sister white,
But little lasts the temper of her pen,
The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,
Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign
All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,
Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;
Then he returns and hope revives again,
Seeing the world has changed its countenance
In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,
And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.
Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,
When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,
And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.
For as we came unto the ruined bridge,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>The Leader turned to me with that sweet look
Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.
His arms he opened, after some advisement
Within himself elected, looking first
Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.
And even as he who acts and meditates,
For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,
So upward lifting me towards the summit
Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,
Saying: 'We've got to climb up there,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>You first, see if it can hold our weight.'
This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;
For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,
Were able to ascend from jag to jag.
And had it not been, that upon that precinct
Shorter was the ascent than on the other,
He I know not, but I had been dead beat.
But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth
Of the profoundest well is all inclining,
The structure of each valley doth import
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>That one bank rises and the other sinks.
Still we arrived at length upon the point
Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.
The breath was from my lungs so milked away,
When I was up, that I could go no farther,
Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.
'Don't you fade on me now, pretty boy.'
My Master said; 'Don't you know that
Rest and relaxation makes you soft?
As the kids say today, do you even lift?
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>You need to pump iron and run miles,
Build your body up to a MACHO state.
So get up off of the ground, slacker!
Raise your spirits, act tough!
Don't be a spineless slug, man!
You're going to have to climb more stairs;
This is just the beginning, let me tell you;
If you hear me, then you'll prepare yourself.'
Then I uprose, showing myself provided
Better with breath than I did feel myself,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>And said: 'Go on, for I am strong and bold.'
Upward we took our way along the crag,
Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,
And more precipitous far than that before.
Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;
Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,
Not well adapted to articulate words.
I know not what it said, though o'er the back
I now was of the arch that passes there;
But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>I was bent downward, but my living eyes
Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;
Wherefore I: 'Master, see that thou arrive
At the next round, and let us descend the wall;
For as from hence I hear and understand not,
So I look down and nothing I distinguish.'
'Don't talk,' he said, 'for a while,
Seriously.  You fill the air with nose
And not the type of madness that I love.'
We from the bridge descended at its head,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,
And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;
And I beheld therein a terrible throng
Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,
That the remembrance still congeals my blood
Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;
For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae
She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,
Neither so many plagues nor so malignant
E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!
Among this cruel and most dismal throng
People were running naked and affrighted.
Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.
They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;
These riveted upon their reins the tail
And head, and were in front of them entwined.
And lo! at one who was upon our side
There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him
There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,
As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly
Behoved it that in falling he became.
And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,
The ashes drew together, and of themselves
Into himself they instantly returned.
Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed
The phoenix dies, and then is born again,
When it approaches its five-hundredth year;
On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>But only on tears of incense and amomum,
And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.
And as he is who falls, and knows not how,
By force of demons who to earth down drag him,
Or other oppilation that binds man,
When he arises and around him looks,
Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish
Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;
Such was that sinner after he had risen.
Justice of God! O how severe it is,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!
The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;
Whence he replied: 'I rained from Tuscany
A short time since into this cruel gorge.
A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,
Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,
Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.'
And I unto the Guide: 'Tell him to stir not,
And ask what crime has thrust him here below,
For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.'
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,
But unto me directed mind and face,
And with a melancholy shame was painted.
Then said: 'It pains me more that thou hast caught me
Amid this misery where thou seest me,
Than when I from the other life was taken.
What thou demandest I cannot deny;
So low am I put down because I robbed
The sacristy of the fair ornaments,
And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,
If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,
Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:
Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;
Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;
Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,
Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,
And with impetuous and bitter tempest
Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;
When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,
<aside class="versenum">150</aside>So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.
And this I've said that it may give thee pain.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXV.</h2>
<div>At the conclusion of his words, the thief
Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,
Crying: 'Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.'
From that time forth the serpents were my friends;
For one entwined itself about his neck
As if it said: 'I will not thou speak more;'
And round his arms another, and rebound him,
Clinching itself together so in front,
That with them he could not a motion make.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not
To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,
Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?
Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,
Spirit I saw not against God so proud,
Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!
He fled away, and spake no further word;
And I beheld a Centaur full of rage
Come crying out: 'Where is, where is the scoffer?'
I do not think Maremma has so many
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Serpents as he had all along his back,
As far as where our countenance begins.
Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,
With wings wide open was a dragon lying,
And he sets fire to all that he encounters.
My Master said: 'That guy is Cacus.
It's said that when he was alive
He created a lake of blood. METAL!
He and his brothers are all here together
Because they were thieves and brigands,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>They stole some cows or sheep or something;
They messed with the wrong guy it seems,
Hercules beat them to death with a mace,
It was pretty gnarly if I may say so.'
While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,
And spirits three had underneath us come,
Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,
Until what time they shouted: 'Who are you?'
On which account our story made a halt,
And then we were intent on them alone.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>I did not know them; but it came to pass,
As it is wont to happen by some chance,
That one to name the other was compelled,
Exclaiming: 'Where can Cianfa have remained?'
Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,
Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.
If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe
What I shall say, it will no marvel be,
For I who saw it hardly can admit it.
As I was holding raised on them my brows,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth
In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.
With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,
And with the forward ones his arms it seized;
Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;
The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,
And put its tail through in between the two,
And up behind along the reins outspread it.
Ivy was never fastened by its barbs
Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.
Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax
They had been made, and intermixed their colour;
Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;
E'en as proceedeth on before the flame
Upward along the paper a brown colour,
Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.
The other two looked on, and each of them
Cried out: 'O me, Agnello, how thou changest!
Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.'
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>Already the two heads had one become,
When there appeared to us two figures mingled
Into one face, wherein the two were lost.
Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,
The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest
Members became that never yet were seen.
Every original aspect there was cancelled;
Two and yet none did the perverted image
Appear, and such departed with slow pace.
Even as a lizard, under the great scourge
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,
Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;
Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies
Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,
Livid and black as is a peppercorn.
And in that part whereat is first received
Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;
Then downward fell in front of him extended.
The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;
Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.
He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;
One through the wound, the other through the mouth
Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.
Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions
Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,
And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.
Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;
For if him to a snake, her to fountain,
Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Because two natures never front to front
Has he transmuted, so that both the forms
To interchange their matter ready were.
Together they responded in such wise,
That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,
And eke the wounded drew his feet together.
The legs together with the thighs themselves
Adhered so, that in little time the juncture
No sign whatever made that was apparent.
He with the cloven tail assumed the figure
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>The other one was losing, and his skin
Became elastic, and the other's hard.
I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,
And both feet of the reptile, that were short,
Lengthen as much as those contracted were.
Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,
Became the member that a man conceals,
And of his own the wretch had two created.
While both of them the exhalation veils
With a new colour, and engenders hair
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>On one of them and depilates the other,
The one uprose and down the other fell,
Though turning not away their impious lamps,
Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.
He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,
And from excess of matter, which came thither,
Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;
What did not backward run and was retained
Of that excess made to the face a nose,
And the lips thickened far as was befitting.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,
And backward draws the ears into his head,
In the same manner as the snail its horns;
And so the tongue, which was entire and apt
For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked
In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.
The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,
Along the valley hissing takes to flight,
And after him the other speaking sputters.
Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>And said to the other: 'I'll have Buoso run,
Crawling as I have done, along this road.'
In this way I beheld the seventh ballast
Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse
The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.
And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be
Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,
They could not flee away so secretly
But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;
And he it was who sole of three companions,
<aside class="versenum">150</aside>Which came in the beginning, was not changed;
The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXVI.</h2>
<div>Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,
That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,
And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!
Among the thieves five citizens of thine
Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,
And thou thereby to no great honour risest.
But if when morn is near our dreams are true,
Feel shalt thou in a little time from now
What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>And if it now were, it were not too soon;
Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,
For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age.
We went our way, and up along the stairs
The bourns had made us to descend before,
Remounted my Conductor and drew me.
And following the solitary path
Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,
The foot without the hand sped not at all.
Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>When I direct my mind to what I saw,
And more my genius curb than I am wont,
That it may run not unless virtue guide it;
So that if some good star, or better thing,
Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.
As many as the hind (who on the hill
Rests at the time when he who lights the world
His countenance keeps least concealed from us,
While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)
Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;
With flames as manifold resplendent all
Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware
As soon as I was where the depth appeared.
And such as he who with the bears avenged him
Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,
What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,
For with his eye he could not follow it
So as to see aught else than flame alone,
Even as a little cloud ascending upward,
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment
Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,
And every flame a sinner steals away.
I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,
So that, if I had seized not on a rock,
Down had I fallen without being pushed.
And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,
Exclaimed: 'They're all in the fire there;
They bathe in the fire even though it burns.'
'My Master,' I replied, 'by hearing thee
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>I am more sure; but I surmised already
It might be so, and already wished to ask thee
Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft
At top, it seems uprising from the pyre
Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.'
He answered me: 'Some pretty famous guys:
Ulysses and Diomed, the Greek heroes
You probably read about them in high school.
It turns out that making the Trojan Horse
Was weirdly interpreted as a sort of lie
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>And so they get to burn in Hell. Oops.
I suspect this plot point has to do
With the fact that Dante was Italian,
So he felt bad about Troy getting sacked.'
'If they within those sparks possess the power
To speak,' I said, 'thee, Master, much I pray,
And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,
That thou make no denial of awaiting
Until the horned flame shall hither come;
Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.'
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And he to me: 'Hey, now you're getting it,
Good on you kid, that's the spirit now;
But hold your tongue for one macho minute.
Let me talk for a bit, because I think I know
What you want to hear about, and why that is.
I've been around long enough to guess.'
When now the flame had come unto that point,
Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,
After this fashion did I hear him speak:
'Wubba wubba, magical fire!  Tell me!
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>I, the Macho Man, demand of you!
Reveal your secrets!  Tell us stories!
Wumbo wumbo, magical fire!  Tell me!
If you don't help me out right now
I will dump water on you! Beware!'
Then of the antique flame the greater horn,
Murmuring, began to wave itself about
Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.
Thereafterward, the summit to and fro
Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>It uttered forth a voice, and said: 'When I
From Circe had departed, who concealed me
More than a year there near unto Gaeta,
Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,
Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence
For my old father, nor the due affection
Which joyous should have made Penelope,
Could overcome within me the desire
I had to be experienced of the world,
And of the vice and virtue of mankind;
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>But I put forth on the high open sea
With one sole ship, and that small company
By which I never had deserted been.
Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,
Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,
And the others which that sea bathes round about.
I and my company were old and slow
When at that narrow passage we arrived
Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,
That man no farther onward should adventure.
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>On the right hand behind me left I Seville,
And on the other already had left Ceuta.
'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand
Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,
To this so inconsiderable vigil
Which is remaining of your senses still
Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,
Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.
Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;
Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'
So eager did I render my companions,
With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,
That then I hardly could have held them back.
And having turned our stern unto the morning,
We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,
Evermore gaining on the larboard side.
Already all the stars of the other pole
The night beheld, and ours so very low
It did not rise above the ocean floor.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Five times rekindled and as many quenched
Had been the splendour underneath the moon,
Since we had entered into the deep pass,
When there appeared to us a mountain, dim
From distance, and it seemed to me so high
As I had never any one beheld.
Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;
For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,
And smote upon the fore part of the ship.
Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,
And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,
Until the sea above us closed again.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXVII.</h2>
<div>Already was the flame erect and quiet,
To speak no more, and now departed from us
With the permission of the gentle Poet;
When yet another, which behind it came,
Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top
By a confused sound that issued from it.
As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first
With the lament of him, and that was right,
Who with his file had modulated it)
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,
That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,
Still it appeared with agony transfixed;
Thus, by not having any way or issue
At first from out the fire, to its own language
Converted were the melancholy words.
But afterwards, when they had gathered way
Up through the point, giving it that vibration
The tongue had given them in their passage out,
We heard it said: 'O thou, at whom I aim
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,
Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'
Because I come perchance a little late,
To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;
Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.
If thou but lately into this blind world
Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,
Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,
Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,
For I was from the mountains there between
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts.'
I still was downward bent and listening,
When my Conductor touched me on the side,
Saying: 'This one is Italian like you.'
And I, who had beforehand my reply
In readiness, forthwith began to speak:
'O soul, that down below there art concealed,
Romagna thine is not and never has been
Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;
But open war I none have left there now.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;
The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,
So that she covers Cervia with her vans.
The city which once made the long resistance,
And of the French a sanguinary heap,
Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;
Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,
Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,
Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.
The cities of Lamone and Santerno
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,
Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;
And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,
Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,
Lives between tyranny and a free state.
Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;
Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,
So may thy name hold front there in the world.'
After the fire a little more had roared
In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:
'If I believed that my reply were made
To one who to the world would e'er return,
This flame without more flickering would stand still;
But inasmuch as never from this depth
Did any one return, if I hear true,
Without the fear of infamy I answer,
I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,
Believing thus begirt to make amends;
And truly my belief had been fulfilled
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,
Who put me back into my former sins;
And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.
While I was still the form of bone and pulp
My mother gave to me, the deeds I did
Were not those of a lion, but a fox.
The machinations and the covert ways
I knew them all, and practised so their craft,
That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.
When now unto that portion of mine age
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>I saw myself arrived, when each one ought
To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,
That which before had pleased me then displeased me;
And penitent and confessing I surrendered,
Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;
The Leader of the modern Pharisees
Having a war near unto Lateran,
And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,
For each one of his enemies was Christian,
And none of them had been to conquer Acre,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,
Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,
In him regarded, nor in me that cord
Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;
But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester
To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,
So this one sought me out as an adept
To cure him of the fever of his pride.
Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,
Because his words appeared inebriate.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;
Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me
How to raze Palestrina to the ground.
Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,
As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,
The which my predecessor held not dear.'
Then urged me on his weighty arguments
There, where my silence was the worst advice;
And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me
Of that sin into which I now must fall,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>The promise long with the fulfilment short
Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'
Francis came afterward, when I was dead,
For me; but one of the black Cherubim
Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;
He must come down among my servitors,
Because he gave the fraudulent advice
From which time forth I have been at his hair;
For who repents not cannot be absolved,
Nor can one both repent and will at once,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Because of the contradiction which consents not.'
O miserable me! how I did shudder
When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure
Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'
He bore me unto Minos, who entwined
Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,
And after he had bitten it in great rage,
Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'
Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,
And vested thus in going I bemoan me.'
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>When it had thus completed its recital,
The flame departed uttering lamentations,
Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.
Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,
Up o'er the crag above another arch,
Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee
By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.

<h2>CANTO XXVIII.</h2>
<div>Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words,
Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full
Which now I saw, by many times narrating?
Each tongue would for a certainty fall short
By reason of our speech and memory,
That have small room to comprehend so much.
If were again assembled all the people
Which formerly upon the fateful land
Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Shed by the Romans and the lingering war
That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,
As Livy has recorded, who errs not,
With those who felt the agony of blows
By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,
And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still
At Ceperano, where a renegade
Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,
Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,
And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Should show, it would be nothing to compare
With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.
A cask by losing centre-piece or cant
Was never shattered so, as I saw one
Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.
Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;
His heart was visible, and the dismal sack
That maketh excrement of what is eaten.
While I was all absorbed in seeing him,
He looked at me, and opened with his hands
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>His bosom, saying: 'See now how I rend me;
How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;
In front of me doth Ali weeping go,
Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;
And all the others whom thou here beholdest,
Disseminators of scandal and of schism
While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.
A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us
Thus cruelly, unto the falchion's edge
Putting again each one of all this ream,
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>When we have gone around the doleful road;
By reason that our wounds are closed again
Ere any one in front of him repass.
But who art thou, that musest on the crag,
Perchance to postpone going to the pain
That is adjudged upon thine accusations?'
'He's not dead yet, and he's not a sinner,'
My Master made reply, 'here for punishment;
He's just here for the sightseeing.
I, on the other hand, am dead, his guide.
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>I'm showing him the ropes of the place;
Because God asked me to do this favor.'
More than a hundred were there when they heard him,
Who in the moat stood still to look at me,
Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.
'Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,
Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,
If soon he wish not here to follow me,
So with provisions, that no stress of snow
May give the victory to the Novarese,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Which otherwise to gain would not be easy.'
After one foot to go away he lifted,
This word did Mahomet say unto me,
Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.
Another one, who had his throat pierced through,
And nose cut off close underneath the brows,
And had no longer but a single ear,
Staying to look in wonder with the others,
Before the others did his gullet open,
Which outwardly was red in every part,
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And said: 'O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,
And whom I once saw up in Latian land,
Unless too great similitude deceive me,
Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,
If e'er thou see again the lovely plain
That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,
And make it known to the best two of Fano,
To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,
That if foreseeing here be not in vain,
Cast over from their vessel shall they be,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>And drowned near unto the Cattolica,
By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.
Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca
Neptune ne'er yet beheld so great a crime,
Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.
That traitor, who sees only with one eye,
And holds the land, which some one here with me
Would fain be fasting from the vision of,
Will make them come unto a parley with him;
Then will do so, that to Focara's wind
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.'
And I to him: 'Show to me and declare,
If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,
Who is this person of the bitter vision.'
Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw
Of one of his companions, and his mouth
Oped, crying: 'This is he, and he speaks not.
This one, being banished, every doubt submerged
In Caesar by affirming the forearmed
Always with detriment allowed delay.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>O how bewildered unto me appeared,
With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,
Curio, who in speaking was so bold!
And one, who both his hands dissevered had,
The stumps uplifting through the murky air,
So that the blood made horrible his face,
Cried out: 'Thou shalt remember Mosca also,
Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!'
Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people.'
'And death unto thy race,' thereto I added;
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,
Departed, like a person sad and crazed.
But I remained to look upon the crowd;
And saw a thing which I should be afraid,
Without some further proof, even to recount,
If it were not that conscience reassures me,
That good companion which emboldens man
Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.
I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,
A trunk without a head walk in like manner
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>As walked the others of the mournful herd.
And by the hair it held the head dissevered,
Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,
And that upon us gazed and said: 'O me!'
It of itself made to itself a lamp,
And they were two in one, and one in two;
How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.
When it was come close to the bridge's foot,
It lifted high its arm with all the head,
To bring more closely unto us its words,
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Which were: 'Behold now the sore penalty,
Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;
Behold if any be as great as this.
And so that thou may carry news of me,
Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same
Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.
I made the father and the son rebellious;
Achitophel not more with Absalom
And David did with his accursed goadings.
Because I parted persons so united,
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!
From its beginning, which is in this trunk.
Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXIX.</h2>
<div>The many people and the divers wounds
These eyes of mine had so inebriated,
That they were wishful to stand still and weep;
But said Randius: 'What are you still looking at?
What is there possibly of interest
Down in the writhing ghost-men?
You never stared like this before now;
We still have a long road to walk,
Twenty-two miles yet to go! Hurry!
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>It's already past midnright! See the moon?
We have only a short amount of time left,
So come on buckaroo, we gotta jet.'
'If thou hadst,' I made answer thereupon,
'Attended to the cause for which I looked,
Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.'
Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him
I went, already making my reply,
And superadding: 'In that cavern where
I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>I think a spirit of my blood laments
The sin which down below there costs so much.'
Then said the Master: 'Don't think about it.
Keep your eyes on the prize and move on;
He isn't going anywhere, and you are;
That is one of the advantages of being alive,
You get to go to other places than this one
And don't have to be stuck in one location.
Just think of the places you could go!
Albania, Morocco, Thailand, Space. Space!
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>You could go to Space!  Space is the place.'
'O my Conductor, his own violent death,
Which is not yet avenged for him,' I said,
'By any who is sharer in the shame,
Made him disdainful; whence he went away,
As I imagine, without speaking to me,
And thereby made me pity him the more.'
Thus did we speak as far as the first place
Upon the crag, which the next valley shows
Down to the bottom, if there were more light.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>When we were now right over the last cloister
Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers
Could manifest themselves unto our sight,
Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,
Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,
Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.
What pain would be, if from the hospitals
Of Valdichiana, 'twixt July and September,
And of Maremma and Sardinia
All the diseases in one moat were gathered,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Such was it here, and such a stench came from it
As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.
We had descended on the furthest bank
From the long crag, upon the left hand still,
And then more vivid was my power of sight
Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress
Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,
Punishes forgers, which she here records.
I do not think a sadder sight to see
Was in Aegina the whole people sick,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>(When was the air so full of pestilence,
The animals, down to the little worm,
All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,
According as the poets have affirmed,
Were from the seed of ants restored again,)
Than was it to behold through that dark valley
The spirits languishing in divers heaps.
This on the belly, that upon the back
One of the other lay, and others crawling
Shifted themselves along the dismal road.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>We step by step went onward without speech,
Gazing upon and listening to the sick
Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.
I saw two sitting leaned against each other,
As leans in heating platter against platter,
From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;
And never saw I plied a currycomb
By stable-boy for whom his master waits,
Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,
As every one was plying fast the bite
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Of nails upon himself, for the great rage
Of itching which no other succour had.
And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,
In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,
Or any other fish that has them largest.
'Hey you!  Yeah, yous with the fingers,'
Began my Leader unto one of them,
'The finger-guys who pinch sometimes,
Are any of you Italians by chance?
My buddy here likes talking to Italians,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Not that he's racist or anything.'
'Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,
Both of us here,' one weeping made reply;
'But who art thou, that questionest about us?'
And said the Guide: 'I am the Macho Man!
With boldness I leap from cliff to cliff,
And I intend to show Hell to this guy.'
Then broken was their mutual support,
And trembling each one turned himself to me,
With others who had heard him by rebound.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,
Saying: 'Now you can talk to them.'
And I began, since he would have it so:
'So may your memory not steal away
In the first world from out the minds of men,
But so may it survive 'neath many suns,
Say to me who ye are, and of what people;
Let not your foul and loathsome punishment
Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.'
'I of Arezzo was,' one made reply,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>'And Albert of Siena had me burned;
But what I died for does not bring me here.
'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,
That I could rise by flight into the air,
And he who had conceit, but little wit,
Would have me show to him the art; and only
Because no Daedalus I made him, made me
Be burned by one who held him as his son.
But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,
For alchemy, which in the world I practised,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.'
And to the Poet said I: 'Now was ever
So vain a people as the Sienese?
Not for a certainty the French by far.'
Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,
Replied unto my speech: 'Taking out Stricca,
Who knew the art of moderate expenses,
And Niccolo, who the luxurious use
Of cloves discovered earliest of all
Within that garden where such seed takes root;
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>And taking out the band, among whom squandered
Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,
And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!
But, that thou know who thus doth second thee
Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye
Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,
And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,
Who metals falsified by alchemy;
Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,
How I a skilful ape of nature was.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXX.</h2>
<div>'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,
For Semele, against the Theban blood,
As she already more than once had shown,
So reft of reason Athamas became,
That, seeing his own wife with children twain
Walking encumbered upon either hand,
He cried: 'Spread out the nets, that I may take
The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;'
And then extended his unpitying claws,
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,
And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;
And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;--
And at the time when fortune downward hurled
The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared,
So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,
Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,
When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,
And of her Polydorus on the shore
Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Out of her senses like a dog she barked,
So much the anguish had her mind distorted;
But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan
Were ever seen in any one so cruel
In goading beasts, and much more human members,
As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,
Who, biting, in the manner ran along
That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.
One to Capocchio came, and by the nape
Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>It made his belly grate the solid bottom.
And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,
Said to me: 'That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,
And raving goes thus harrying other people.'
'O,' said I to him, 'so may not the other
Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee
To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.'
And he to me: 'That is the ancient ghost
Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became
Beyond all rightful love her father's lover.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>She came to sin with him after this manner,
By counterfeiting of another's form;
As he who goeth yonder undertook,
That he might gain the lady of the herd,
To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,
Making a will and giving it due form.'
And after the two maniacs had passed
On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back
To look upon the other evil-born.
I saw one made in fashion of a lute,
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>If he had only had the groin cut off
Just at the point at which a man is forked.
The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions
The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,
That the face corresponds not to the belly,
Compelled him so to hold his lips apart
As does the hectic, who because of thirst
One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns.
'O ye, who without any torment are,
And why I know not, in the world of woe,'
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>He said to us, 'behold, and be attentive
Unto the misery of Master Adam;
I had while living much of what I wished,
And now, alas! a drop of water crave.
The rivulets, that from the verdant hills
Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,
Making their channels to be cold and moist,
Ever before me stand, and not in vain;
For far more doth their image dry me up
Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>The rigid justice that chastises me
Draweth occasion from the place in which
I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.
There is Romena, where I counterfeited
The currency imprinted with the Baptist,
For which I left my body burned above.
But if I here could see the tristful soul
Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,
For Branda's fount I would not give the sight.
One is within already, if the raving
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Shades that are going round about speak truth;
But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?
If I were only still so light, that in
A hundred years I could advance one inch,
I had already started on the way,
Seeking him out among this squalid folk,
Although the circuit be eleven miles,
And be not less than half a mile across.
For them am I in such a family;
They did induce me into coining florins,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>Which had three carats of impurity.'
And I to him: 'Who are the two poor wretches
That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,
Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?'
'I found them here,' replied he, 'when I rained
Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,
Nor do I think they will for evermore.
One the false woman is who accused Joseph,
The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;
From acute fever they send forth such reek.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed
At being, peradventure, named so darkly,
Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.
It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;
And Master Adam smote him in the face,
With arm that did not seem to be less hard,
Saying to him: 'Although be taken from me
All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,
I have an arm unfettered for such need.'
Whereat he answer made: 'When thou didst go
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:
But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.'
The dropsical: 'Thou sayest true in that;
But thou wast not so true a witness there,
Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.'
'If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,'
Said Sinon; 'and for one fault I am here,
And thou for more than any other demon.'
'Remember, perjurer, about the horse,'
He made reply who had the swollen belly,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>'And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.'
'Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks
Thy tongue,' the Greek said, 'and the putrid water
That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.'
Then the false-coiner: 'So is gaping wide
Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;
Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me
Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,
And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus
Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.'
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,
When said the Master to me: 'Just look,
Don't speak, or I'll get mad at you.'
When him I heard in anger speak to me,
I turned me round towards him with such shame
That still it eddies through my memory.
And as he is who dreams of his own harm,
Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,
So that he craves what is, as if it were not;
Such I became, not having power to speak,
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>For to excuse myself I wished, and still
Excused myself, and did not think I did it.
'People have felt less bad over worse sins,'
The Master said, 'than you have committed;
So don't beat yourself up about it,
Remember that the Macho Man is beside you,
And that while we are together all is well
Take this knowledge and with it be secure;
And in the future ignore boring gossipheads.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXI.</h2>
<div>One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,
So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,
And then held out to me the medicine;
Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear,
His and his father's, used to be the cause
First of a sad and then a gracious boon.
We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,
Upon the bank that girds it round about,
Going across it without any speech.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>There it was less than night, and less than day,
So that my sight went little in advance;
But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,
So loud it would have made each thunder faint,
Which, counter to it following its way,
Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.
After the dolorous discomfiture
When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,
So terribly Orlando sounded not.
Short while my head turned thitherward I held
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>When many lofty towers I seemed to see,
Whereat I: 'Master, say, what town is this?'
And he to me: 'You're looking far ahead
Into what is deep and black darkness,
I think you don't know what you see.
When we get there you will find out,
How wrong you are about what you see;
So I'll say yet again: keep moving.'
Then tenderly he took me by the hand,
And said: 'Before we go any further,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>To prep you for what is coming up,
I'm going to tell you right now what to expect,
Those things are giants yo, not towers.
They're huge.  Don't mess with them.'
As, when the fog is vanishing away,
Little by little doth the sight refigure
Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,
So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,
More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,
My error fled, and fear came over me;
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Because as on its circular parapets
Montereggione crowns itself with towers,
E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well
With one half of their bodies turreted
The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces
E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.
And I of one already saw the face,
Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,
And down along his sides both of the arms.
Certainly Nature, when she left the making
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Of animals like these, did well indeed,
By taking such executors from Mars;
And if of elephants and whales she doth not
Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly
More just and more discreet will hold her for it;
For where the argument of intellect
Is added unto evil will and power,
No rampart can the people make against it.
His face appeared to me as long and large
As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>And in proportion were the other bones;
So that the margin, which an apron was
Down from the middle, showed so much of him
Above it, that to reach up to his hair
Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;
For I beheld thirty great palms of him
Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.
'Raphael mai amech izabi almi,'
Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,
To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And unto him my Guide: 'Idiot soul,
Get away from us and blow your horn,
Whenever you are feeling out of sorts.
It's hanging around your neck, you fool
I know you're too stupid to remember this,
But if you look down you'll surely find it.'
Then said to me: 'This guy is The Worst;
His name is Nimrod and he lives up to it.
He barely is able to understand words.
Don't bother talking to him, it's pointless;
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>He will probably just get mad and confused
That's what always happens. I would know.'
Therefore a longer journey did we make,
Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft
We found another far more fierce and large.
In binding him, who might the master be
I cannot say; but he had pinioned close
Behind the right arm, and in front the other,
With chains, that held him so begirt about
From the neck down, that on the part uncovered
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.
'This cocky fellow decided to pick a fight
And pit his own strength against Jupiter,'
My Leader said, 'the God, not the planet.
Ephialtes is his name; and he was strong.
But not strong enough to defeat Zeus;
So now he's chained here like a sucker.'
And I to him: 'If possible, I should wish
That of the measureless Briareus
These eyes of mine might have experience.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Whence he replied: 'You'll get to see Antaeus
He's close by and free to speak with us,
Lucky for him he never was chained up.
Further past him is the one you mentioned,
He is bound, much like Ephialtes here,
Except Briareus is way more fearsome.'
There never was an earthquake of such might
That it could shake a tower so violently,
As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.
Then was I more afraid of death than ever,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>For nothing more was needful than the fear,
If I had not beheld the manacles.
Then we proceeded farther in advance,
And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells
Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.
'Hey Antaeus buddy, long time no see!
How's it going down here?  Still sucky?
That's a shame. Look, this here is Dante.
I'm guiding his sorry rear through Hell,
And we need a little bit of help from you.
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Do you think you could lend us a hand?
It would take us a long time of traveling
Whereas if you could grap and pick us up,
We could make some really excellent time.
Don't forget that you owe me Antaeus,
I never collected on last month's poker game;
And if you do this for us I'll call us square.
Plus there's something in it for you as well;
This guy is alive; when he goes back to Earth,
He'll totally tell everybody how cool you are.'
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>So said the Master; and in haste the other
His hands extended and took up my Guide,--
Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.
Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,
Said unto me: 'Come on buddy, grab my hand;'
Then of himself and me one bundle made.
As seems the Carisenda, to behold
Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud
Above it so that opposite it hangs;
Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>Watching to see him stoop, and then it was
I could have wished to go some other way.
But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up
Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;
Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,
But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXII.</h2>
<div>If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,
As were appropriate to the dismal hole
Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,
I would press out the juice of my conception
More fully; but because I have them not,
Not without fear I bring myself to speak;
For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,
To sketch the bottom of all the universe,
Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,
Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,
That from the fact the word be not diverse.
O rabble ill-begotten above all,
Who're in the place to speak of which is hard,
'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!
When we were down within the darksome well,
Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,
And I was scanning still the lofty wall,
I heard it said to me: 'Look how thou steppest!
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet
The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!'
Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me
And underfoot a lake, that from the frost
The semblance had of glass, and not of water.
So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current
In winter-time Danube in Austria,
Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,
As there was here; so that if Tambernich
Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak.
And as to croak the frog doth place himself
With muzzle out of water,--when is dreaming
Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,--
Livid, as far down as where shame appears,
Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,
Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.
Each one his countenance held downward bent;
From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart
Among them witness of itself procures.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>When round about me somewhat I had looked,
I downward turned me, and saw two so close,
The hair upon their heads together mingled.
'Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,'
I said, 'who are you;' and they bent their necks,
And when to me their faces they had lifted,
Their eyes, which first were only moist within,
Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed
The tears between, and locked them up again.
Clamp never bound together wood with wood
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,
Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.
And one, who had by reason of the cold
Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,
Said: 'Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?
If thou desire to know who these two are,
The valley whence Bisenzio descends
Belonged to them and to their father Albert.
They from one body came, and all Caina
Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;
Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow
At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;
Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers
So with his head I see no farther forward,
And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;
Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.
And that thou put me not to further speech,
Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,
And wait Carlino to exonerate me.'
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made
Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,
And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.
And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,
Where everything of weight unites together,
And I was shivering in the eternal shade,
Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,
I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads
I struck my foot hard in the face of one.
Weeping he growled: 'Why dost thou trample me?
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?'
And I: 'My Master, now wait here for me,
That I through him may issue from a doubt;
Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.'
The Leader stopped; and to that one I said
Who was blaspheming vehemently still:
'Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?'
'Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora
Smiting,' replied he, 'other people's cheeks,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?'
'Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,'
Was my response, 'if thou demandest fame,
That 'mid the other notes thy name I place.'
And he to me: 'For the reverse I long;
Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;
For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.'
Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,
And said: 'It must needs be thou name thyself,
Or not a hair remain upon thee here.'
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>Whence he to me: 'Though thou strip off my hair,
I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,
If on my head a thousand times thou fall.'
I had his hair in hand already twisted,
And more than one shock of it had pulled out,
He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,
When cried another: 'What doth ail thee, Bocca?
Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,
But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?'
'Now,' said I, 'I care not to have thee speak,
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame
I will report of thee veracious news.'
'Begone,' replied he, 'and tell what thou wilt,
But be not silent, if thou issue hence,
Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;
He weepeth here the silver of the French;
'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera
There where the sinners stand out in the cold.'
If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,
Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;
Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be
Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello
Who oped Faenza when the people slep.'
Already we had gone away from him,
When I beheld two frozen in one hole,
So that one head a hood was to the other;
And even as bread through hunger is devoured,
The uppermost on the other set his teeth,
There where the brain is to the nape united.
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed
The temples of Menalippus in disdain,
Than that one did the skull and the other things.
'O thou, who showest by such bestial sign
Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,
Tell me the wherefore,' said I, 'with this compact,
That if thou rightfully of him complain,
In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,
I in the world above repay thee for it,
If that wherewith I speak be not dried up.'
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXIII.</h2>
<div>His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,
That sinner, wiping it upon the hair
Of the same head that he behind had wasted.
Then he began: 'Thou wilt that I renew
The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already
To think of only, ere I speak of it;
But if my words be seed that may bear fruit
Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,
Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>I know not who thou art, nor by what mode
Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine
Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.
Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,
And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;
Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.
That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,
Trusting in him I was made prisoner,
And after put to death, I need not say;
But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>That is to say, how cruel was my death,
Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.
A narrow perforation in the mew,
Which bears because of me the title of Famine,
And in which others still must be locked up,
Had shown me through its opening many moons
Already, when I dreamed the evil dream
Which of the future rent for me the veil.
This one appeared to me as lord and master,
Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.
With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,
Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi
He had sent out before him to the front.
After brief course seemed unto me forespent
The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes
It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.
When I before the morrow was awake,
Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons
Who with me were, and asking after bread.
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,
Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,
And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?
They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh
At which our food used to be brought to us,
And through his dream was each one apprehensive;
And I heard locking up the under door
Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word
I gazed into the faces of my sons.
I wept not, I within so turned to stone;
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>They wept; and darling little Anselm mine
Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'
Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made
All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,
Until another sun rose on the world.
As now a little glimmer made its way
Into the dolorous prison, and I saw
Upon four faces my own very aspect,
Both of my hands in agony I bit;
And, thinking that I did it from desire
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,
And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us
If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us
With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'
I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.
That day we all were silent, and the next.
Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?
When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo
Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,
Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,
I saw the three fall, one by one, between
The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,
Already blind, to groping over each,
And three days called them after they were dead;
Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.'
When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,
The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,
Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.
Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,
Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,
Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,
And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno
That every person in thee it may drown!
For if Count Ugolino had the fame
Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,
Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.
Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!
Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>And the other two my song doth name above!
We passed still farther onward, where the ice
Another people ruggedly enswathes,
Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.
Weeping itself there does not let them weep,
And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;
Because the earliest tears a cluster form,
And, in the manner of a crystal visor,
Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,
Because of cold all sensibility
Its station had abandoned in my face,
Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;
Whence I: 'My Master, who sets this in motion?
Is not below here every vapour quenched?'
Whence he to me: 'Very soon you'll know.
You will see with your own eyes the answer,
And know the source of the frigid winds.'
And one of the wretches of the frozen crust
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Cried out to us: 'O souls so merciless
That the last post is given unto you,
Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I
May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart
A little, e'er the weeping recongeal.'
Whence I to him: 'If thou wouldst have me help thee
Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,
May I go to the bottom of the ice.'
Then he replied: 'I am Friar Alberigo;
He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,
<aside class="versenum">120</aside>Who here a date am getting for my fig.'
'O,' said I to him, 'now art thou, too, dead?'
And he to me: 'How may my body fare
Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.
Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,
That oftentimes the soul descendeth here
Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.
And, that thou mayest more willingly remove
From off my countenance these glassy tears,
Know that as soon as any soul betrays
<aside class="versenum">130</aside>As I have done, his body by a demon
Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,
Until his time has wholly been revolved.
Itself down rushes into such a cistern;
And still perchance above appears the body
Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.
This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;
It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years
Have passed away since he was thus locked up.'
'I think,' said I to him, 'thou dost deceive me;
<aside class="versenum">140</aside>For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,
And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.'
'In moat above,' said he, 'of Malebranche,
There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,
As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,
When this one left a devil in his stead
In his own body and one near of kin,
Who made together with him the betrayal.
But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,
Open mine eyes;'--and open them I did not,
<aside class="versenum">150</aside>And to be rude to him was courtesy.
Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance
With every virtue, full of every vice
Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?
For with the vilest spirit of Romagna
I found of you one such, who for his deeds
In soul already in Cocytus bathes,
And still above in body seems alive!
</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXIV.</h2>
<div>'Now we are in the pit of Hell,
Now look at what lies at the core,'
My Master said, 'if you can see him.'
As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when
Our hemisphere is darkening into night,
Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,
Methought that such a building then I saw;
And, for the wind, I drew myself behind
My Guide, because there was no other shelter.
<aside class="versenum">10</aside>Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,
There where the shades were wholly covered up,
And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.
Some prone are lying, others stand erect,
This with the head, and that one with the soles;
Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.
When in advance so far we had proceeded,
That it my Master pleased to show to me
The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,
He from before me moved and made me stop,
<aside class="versenum">20</aside>Saying: 'Look upon the core of Hell,
And summon your most Macho of spirits!'
How frozen I became and powerless then,
Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,
Because all language would be insufficient.
I did not die, and I alive remained not;
Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,
What I became, being of both deprived.
The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous
From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;
<aside class="versenum">30</aside>And better with a giant I compare
Than do the giants with those arms of his;
Consider now how great must be that whole,
Which unto such a part conforms itself.
Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,
And lifted up his brow against his Maker,
Well may proceed from him all tribulation.
O, what a marvel it appeared to me,
When I beheld three faces on his head!
The one in front, and that vermilion was;
<aside class="versenum">40</aside>Two were the others, that were joined with this
Above the middle part of either shoulder,
And they were joined together at the crest;
And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;
The left was such to look upon as those
Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.
Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,
Such as befitting were so great a bird;
Sails of the sea I never saw so large.
No feathers had they, but as of a bat
<aside class="versenum">50</aside>Their fashion was; and he was waving them,
So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.
Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.
With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins
Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.
At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching
A sinner, in the manner of a brake,
So that he three of them tormented thus.
To him in front the biting was as naught
Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine
<aside class="versenum">60</aside>Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.
'That soul up there which has the greatest pain,'
The Master said, 'is Judas Iscariot;
You cna probably figure out why.
If you look a little lower in the mouth,
You can see a fellow hanging; that's Brutus.
The way he writhes shows he must be in pain.
The third one there is Cassius. See him?
But the night is almost over now, yes?
We need to press on. You've seen it all.'
<aside class="versenum">70</aside>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,
And he the vantage seized of time and place,
And when the wings were opened wide apart,
He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;
From fell to fell descended downward then
Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.
When we were come to where the thigh revolves
Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,
The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,
Turned round his head where he had had his legs,
<aside class="versenum">80</aside>And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,
So that to Hell I thought we were returning.
'Hold on tight and make sure not to slip,'
The Master said, panting as one fatigued,
'We are leaving the center of evil behind.'
Then through the opening of a rock he issued,
And down upon the margin seated me;
Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.
I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see
Lucifer in the same way I had left him;
<aside class="versenum">90</aside>And I beheld him upward hold his legs.
And if I then became disquieted,
Let stolid people think who do not see
What the point is beyond which I had passed.
'Rise up,' the Master said, 'on your feet;
The way is long, and the road is hard,
And the sun is now rising in the sky.'
It was not any palace corridor
There where we were, but dungeon natural,
With floor uneven and unease of light.
<aside class="versenum">100</aside>'Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,
My Master,' said I when I had arisen,
'To draw me from an error speak a little;
Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed
Thus upside down? and how in such short time
From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?'
And he to me: 'A wizard did it.'
A place there is below, from Beelzebub
As far receding as the tomb extends,
Which not by sight is known, but by the sound
<aside class="versenum">110</aside>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth
Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed
With course that winds about and slightly falls.
The Guide and I into that hidden road
Now entered, to return to the bright world;
And without care of having any rest
We mounted up, he first and I the second,
Till I beheld through a round aperture
Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;
Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.
