<h1>I N F E R N O</h1>
<h1>N E W  G A M E  P L U S</h1>
<h3>By Dante Alighieri</h3>
<h2>CANTO I.</h2>
<div>Midway upon the journey of our life</div>
<div>I found myself within a forest dark,</div>
<div>For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</div>
<div>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say</div>
<div>What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,</div>
<div>Which in the very thought renews the fear.</div>
<div>So bitter is it, death is little more;</div>
<div>But of the good to treat, which there I found,</div>
<div>Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,</div>
<div>So full was I of slumber at the moment</div>
<div>In which I had abandoned the true way.</div>
<div>But after I had reached a mountain's foot,</div>
<div>At that point where the valley terminated,</div>
<div>Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</div>
<div>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,</div>
<div>Vested already with that planet's rays</div>
<div>Which leadeth others right by every road.</div>
<div>Then was the fear a little quieted</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>That in my heart's lake had endured throughout</div>
<div>The night, which I had passed so piteously.</div>
<div>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,</div>
<div>Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,</div>
<div>Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</div>
<div>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,</div>
<div>Turn itself back to re-behold the pass</div>
<div>Which never yet a living person left.</div>
<div>After my weary body I had rested,</div>
<div>The way resumed I on the desert slope,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>So that the firm foot ever was the lower.</div>
<div>And lo! almost where the ascent began,</div>
<div>A panther light and swift exceedingly,</div>
<div>Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!</div>
<div>And never moved she from before my face,</div>
<div>Nay, rather did impede so much my way,</div>
<div>That many times I to return had turned.</div>
<div>The time was the beginning of the morning,</div>
<div>And up the sun was mounting with those stars</div>
<div>That with him were, what time the Love Divine</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>At first in motion set those beauteous things;</div>
<div>So were to me occasion of good hope,</div>
<div>The variegated skin of that wild beast,</div>
<div>The hour of time, and the delicious season;</div>
<div>But not so much, that did not give me fear</div>
<div>A lion's aspect which appeared to me.</div>
<div>He seemed as if against me he were coming</div>
<div>With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,</div>
<div>So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;</div>
<div>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,</div>
<div>And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</div>
<div>She brought upon me so much heaviness,</div>
<div>With the affright that from her aspect came,</div>
<div>That I the hope relinquished of the height.</div>
<div>And as he is who willingly acquires,</div>
<div>And the time comes that causes him to lose,</div>
<div>Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</div>
<div>E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,</div>
<div>Which, coming on against me by degrees</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.</div>
<div>While I was rushing downward to the lowland,</div>
<div>Before mine eyes did one present himself,</div>
<div>Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</div>
<div>When I beheld him in the desert vast,</div>
<div>'Have pity on me,' unto him I cried,</div>
<div>'Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!'</div>
<div>He answered me: A man;  a macho man I am,</div>
<div>And both my parents were of Ohio,</div>
<div>And American by country both of them.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>'Randy Poffo' was I born, though it was late,</div>
<div>And lived at Columbus under the good Eisenhower,</div>
<div>During the time of the war in Vietnam.</div>
<div>An athlete was I, and I batted in the minors</div>
<div>those red birds of Saint Louis, Cardinals,</div>
<div>Before the Macho Man took to combat.</div>
<div>But brother, why are you going back to such annoyance?</div>
<div>Why aren't you heading up to heaven instead,</div>
<div>Where all the good people always go?'</div>
<div>'Now, art thou that Macho Man and that fighter</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>To whom there is no limit but the sky?'</div>
<div>I made response to him with bashful forehead.</div>
<div>'O, of the other wrestlers honour and light,</div>
<div>Avail me the long study and great love</div>
<div>That have impelled me to explore thy technique!</div>
<div>Thou art my master, and my author thou,</div>
<div>Thou art alone the one from whom I took</div>
<div>The beautiful style that has done honour to me.</div>
<div>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;</div>
<div>Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.'</div>
<div>'You should head to somewhere less grody,'</div>
<div>Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,</div>
<div>'Unlike me, you cannot afford to look ridiculous;</div>
<div>Because this beast, at which you are raging,</div>
<div>Doesn't ever let anybody past her,</div>
<div>She'll mess you up something wicked;</div>
<div>She, like me, is a tower of power</div>
<div>She is funky like a monkey and hungry too,</div>
<div>And after food is hungrier than before.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Let me tell you something buddy,</div>
<div>She may be strong but compared to her I'm stronger!</div>
<div>She better watch out because I'm coming for her.</div>
<div>You cannot hide or run from the Nacho Man,</div>
<div>My arm is long and my eyes see into space;</div>
<div>There is no nation that is not the Nacho Nation;</div>
<div>Of all the world I am the savior,</div>
<div>Pedal to the metal!  Everybody knows it!</div>
<div>Oh yeah, let me tell you what I'll do;</div>
<div>Through every city shall I will hunt her down,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Until I have driven her back to Hell,</div>
<div>Where some weaksauce demon let her loose.</div>
<div>I know what's best and what is MACHO!</div>
<div>Follow me buddy, and I will be your guide,</div>
<div>We're going to have a real adventure.</div>
<div>You're going to see some pretty gnarly stuff</div>
<div>Some ancient ghosts and boogums that go woo,</div>
<div>Maybe you'll be sad if you're a wuss;</div>
<div>You'll also see some pretty happy folks</div>
<div>They're happy mostly because I visit them,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Everybody treasures a visit from the Nacho;</div>
<div>If you want to go to heaven afterwords,</div>
<div>To meet your ladyfriend or whatever;</div>
<div>That's where we'll part ways I guess;</div>
<div>Because that rightious dude who rules heaven,</div>
<div>Has tasked me with bringing macho madness</div>
<div>To those less fortunate, so I remain.</div>
<div>Heaven is the most macho city of all;</div>
<div>And until all are macho I must wait;</div>
<div>This is my holy task, a righteous one.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>And I to him: 'Sir, I thee entreat,</div>
<div>By that same God whom thou didst never know,</div>
<div>So that I may escape this woe and worse,</div>
<div>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,</div>
<div>That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,</div>
<div>And those thou makest so disconsolate.'</div>
<div>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</div>
<h2>CANTO II.</h2>
<div>Day was departing, and the embrowned air</div>
<div>Released the animals that are on earth</div>
<div>From their fatigues; and I the only one</div>
<div>Made myself ready to sustain the war,</div>
<div>Both of the way and likewise of the woe,</div>
<div>Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</div>
<div>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!</div>
<div>O memory, that didst write down what I saw,</div>
<div>Here thy nobility shall be manifest!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>And I began: 'Poet, who guidest me,</div>
<div>Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,</div>
<div>Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</div>
<div>Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,</div>
<div>While yet corruptible, unto the world</div>
<div>Immortal went, and was there bodily.</div>
<div>But if the adversary of all evil</div>
<div>Was courteous, thinking of the high effect</div>
<div>That issue would from him, and who, and what,</div>
<div>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>For he was of great Rome, and of her empire</div>
<div>In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</div>
<div>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,</div>
<div>Were stablished as the holy place, wherein</div>
<div>Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.</div>
<div>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,</div>
<div>Things did he hear, which the occasion were</div>
<div>Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</div>
<div>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,</div>
<div>To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Which of salvation's way is the beginning.</div>
<div>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?</div>
<div>I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,</div>
<div>Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</div>
<div>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,</div>
<div>I fear the coming may be ill-advised;</div>
<div>Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.'</div>
<div>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,</div>
<div>And by new thoughts doth his intention change,</div>
<div>So that from his design he quite withdraws,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,</div>
<div>Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,</div>
<div>Which was so very prompt in the beginning.</div>
<div>'If the Macho Man catches your drift,'</div>
<div>Replied that shade of the Champion,</div>
<div>'You're a giant coward baby whiner,</div>
<div>And your lameness drags you down awful fierce,</div>
<div>It makes you shake like a sad puppydog,</div>
<div>Like some sort of weird lame animal thing.</div>
<div>Nevertheless stick with the Macho Man</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>And I'll tell you why I'm here right now</div>
<div>And why a champ like me would help you.</div>
<div>I was pumping iron at the gym one day,</div>
<div>When a hot lady ghost came up to me</div>
<div>I cannot refuse a pretty lady.</div>
<div>She had these killer eyes like wow;</div>
<div>And her voice really revved my engine,</div>
<div>Here's the madness that she spoke:</div>
<div>'O spirit courteous of Mantua,</div>
<div>Of whom the fame still in the world endures,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;</div>
<div>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,</div>
<div>Upon the desert slope is so impeded</div>
<div>Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</div>
<div>And may, I fear, already be so lost,</div>
<div>That I too late have risen to his succour,</div>
<div>From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</div>
<div>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,</div>
<div>And with what needful is for his release,</div>
<div>Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;</div>
<div>I come from there, where I would fain return;</div>
<div>Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</div>
<div>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,</div>
<div>Full often will I praise thee unto him.'</div>
<div>Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</div>
<div>Beatrice, you're super hot</div>
<div>I cannot resist. I'll do whatever you say.</div>
<div>Nobody else in heaven is as rad as you.</div>
<div>I'll happily do whatever you want</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>It's a pleasure to please a lady like you</div>
<div>Consider your every desire fulfilled</div>
<div>But could you do the Macho one favor</div>
<div>It's a lot of work you've asked me to do,</div>
<div>So if you could snap into a Slim Jim that'd be rad.'</div>
<div>'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,</div>
<div>Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,</div>
<div>'Why I am not afraid to enter here.</div>
<div>Of those things only should one be afraid</div>
<div>Which have the power of doing others harm;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</div>
<div>God in his mercy such created me</div>
<div>That misery of yours attains me not,</div>
<div>Nor any flame assails me of this burning.</div>
<div>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves</div>
<div>At this impediment, to which I send thee,</div>
<div>So that stern judgment there above is broken.</div>
<div>In her entreaty she besought Lucia,</div>
<div>And said, 'Thy faithful one now stands in need</div>
<div>Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,</div>
<div>Hastened away, and came unto the place</div>
<div>Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.</div>
<div>'Beatrice' said she, 'the true praise of God,</div>
<div>Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,</div>
<div>For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?</div>
<div>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?</div>
<div>Dost thou not see the death that combats him</div>
<div>Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?'</div>
<div>Never were persons in the world so swift</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>To work their weal and to escape their woe,</div>
<div>As I, after such words as these were uttered,</div>
<div>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,</div>
<div>Confiding in thy dignified discourse,</div>
<div>Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'</div>
<div>After she said all that stuff,</div>
<div>She was crying, my pecs left her in awe;</div>
<div>So I left before I could further blow her mind;</div>
<div>And so I found you like she wanted;</div>
<div>I totally rocked that wild monster,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>That was blocking your climb up the mountain.</div>
<div>So why is it you're being so lame?</div>
<div>What is holding back your Macho Spirit?</div>
<div>Why aren't you as cool as I am?</div>
<div>Given that three hot chicks are waiting</div>
<div>They're in Heaven right now watching the clock,</div>
<div>You can trust my word on that my friend.'</div>
<div>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,</div>
<div>Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,</div>
<div>Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Such I became with my exhausted strength,</div>
<div>And such good courage to my heart there coursed,</div>
<div>That I began, like an intrepid person:</div>
<div>'O she compassionate, who succoured me,</div>
<div>And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon</div>
<div>The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</div>
<div>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed</div>
<div>To the adventure, with these words of thine,</div>
<div>That to my first intent I have returned.</div>
<div>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.'</div>
<div>Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</div>
<div>I entered on the deep and savage way.</div>
<h2>CANTO III.</h2>
<div>Through me the way is to the city dolent;</div>
<div>Through me the way is to eternal dole;</div>
<div>Through me the way among the people lost.</div>
<div>Justice incited my sublime Creator;</div>
<div>Created me divine Omnipotence,</div>
<div>The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.</div>
<div>Before me there were no created things,</div>
<div>Only eterne, and I eternal last.</div>
<div>All hope abandon, ye who enter in!'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>These words in sombre colour I beheld</div>
<div>Written upon the summit of a gate;</div>
<div>Whence I: 'Their sense is, Master, hard to me!'</div>
<div>And he to me, as one experienced:</div>
<div>'Just don't be suspicious, lil' macho,</div>
<div>If you're scared then you'll never make it.</div>
<div>We're coming up to a lame-ass place</div>
<div>Full of bummed-out sad people</div>
<div>Who honestly are not the smartest.'</div>
<div>And after he had laid his hand on mine</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,</div>
<div>He led me in among the secret things.</div>
<div>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud</div>
<div>Resounded through the air without a star,</div>
<div>Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.</div>
<div>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,</div>
<div>Accents of anger, words of agony,</div>
<div>And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,</div>
<div>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on</div>
<div>For ever in that air for ever black,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.</div>
<div>And I, who had my head with horror bound,</div>
<div>Said:'Master, what is this which now I hear?</div>
<div>What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'The way they whine</div>
<div>And complain about being in pain</div>
<div>Teminds them that they're in pain.  It's weird.</div>
<div>They're basically just Angels who were selfish</div>
<div>I dunno, they didn't go for God or Satan</div>
<div>Mostly they just cared about themselves.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>They got kicked out of heaven</div>
<div>But Hell sure as hell won't take them,</div>
<div>So really they're like angel hobos.'</div>
<div>And I: 'O Master, what so grievous is</div>
<div>To these, that maketh them lament so sore?'</div>
<div>He answered: 'Alright, well in a nutshell.</div>
<div>They can't evr hope to die,</div>
<div>Their life as is ain't funky enough,</div>
<div>So they just envy everybody else.</div>
<div>They have no reputation at all;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Good folks and bad both hate them.</div>
<div>So gawk if you want, but lets keep rolling.'</div>
<div>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,</div>
<div>Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,</div>
<div>That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;</div>
<div>And after it there came so long a train</div>
<div>Of people, that I ne'er would have believed</div>
<div>That ever Death so many had undone.</div>
<div>When some among them I had recognised.</div>
<div>I looked, and I beheld the shade of him</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</div>
<div>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,</div>
<div>That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches</div>
<div>Hateful to God and to his enemies.</div>
<div>These miscreants, who never were alive,</div>
<div>Were naked, and were stung exceedingly</div>
<div>By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</div>
<div>These did their faces irrigate with blood,</div>
<div>Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet</div>
<div>By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And when to gazing farther I betook me.</div>
<div>People I saw on a great river's bank;</div>
<div>Whence said I: ' Master, now vouchsafe to me,</div>
<div>That I may know who these are, and what law</div>
<div>Makes them appear so ready to pass over,</div>
<div>As I discern athwart the dusky light.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Jesus Christ dude</div>
<div>You ask so many, TOO many questions</div>
<div>Once we get to the river you'll see.'</div>
<div>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Fearing my words might irksome be to him,</div>
<div>From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</div>
<div>And lo! towards us coming in a boat</div>
<div>An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,</div>
<div>Crying: ' Woe unto you, ye souls depraved</div>
<div>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;</div>
<div>I come to lead you to the other shore,</div>
<div>To the eternal shades in heat and frost.</div>
<div>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,</div>
<div>Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead-</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</div>
<div>He said:'By other ways, by other ports</div>
<div>Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for,passage;</div>
<div>A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.'</div>
<div>And unto him the Guide:'Vex thee not, Charon;</div>
<div>It is so willed there where is power to do</div>
<div>That which is willed; and farther question not.'</div>
<div>There at were quieted the fleecy cheeks</div>
<div>Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,</div>
<div>Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>But all those souls who weary were and naked</div>
<div>Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,</div>
<div>As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</div>
<div>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,</div>
<div>The human race, the place, the time, the seed</div>
<div>Of their engendering and of their birth!</div>
<div>Thereafter all together they drew back,</div>
<div>Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,</div>
<div>Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</div>
<div>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Beckoning to them, collects them all together,</div>
<div>Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</div>
<div>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,</div>
<div>First one and then another, till the branch</div>
<div>Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</div>
<div>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam</div>
<div>Throw themselves from that margin one by one,</div>
<div>At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</div>
<div>So they depart across the dusky wave,</div>
<div>And ere upon the other side they land,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Again on this side a new troop assembles.</div>
<div>'My son,'the courteous Master said to me,</div>
<div>'All those who perish in the wrath of God</div>
<div>Here meet together out of every land;</div>
<div>And ready are they to pass o'er the river,</div>
<div>Because celestial Justice spurs them on,</div>
<div>So that their fear is turned into desire.</div>
<div>This way there never passes a good soul;</div>
<div>And hence if Charon doth complain of thee</div>
<div>Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>This being finished, all the dusk champaign</div>
<div>Trembled so violently, that of that terror</div>
<div>The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</div>
<div>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,</div>
<div>And fulminated a vermilion light,</div>
<div>'Which overmastered in me every sense,</div>
<div>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</div>
<h2>CANTO IV.</h2>
<div>Broke the deep lethargy within my head</div>
<div>A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,</div>
<div>Like to a person who by force is wakened;</div>
<div>And round about I moved my rested eyes,</div>
<div>Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,</div>
<div>To recognise the place wherein I was.</div>
<div>True is it, that upon the verge I found me</div>
<div>Of the abysmal valley dolorous,</div>
<div>That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,</div>
<div>So that by fixing on its depths my sight</div>
<div>Nothing whatever I discerned therein.</div>
<div>'We're in space, and space is the place,'</div>
<div>Began the Champ, pallid utterly;</div>
<div>'The madness is running wild, and so shall you.'</div>
<div>And I, who of his colour was aware,</div>
<div>Said: 'How shall I come, if thou art afraid,</div>
<div>Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Let me tell you now a man</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>of my position can afford</div>
<div>to look ridiculous at any time.</div>
<div>Now let's go, follow the Nacho Man.'</div>
<div>Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter</div>
<div>The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.</div>
<div>There, as it seemed to me from listening,</div>
<div>Were lamentations none, but only sighs,</div>
<div>That tremble made the everlasting air.</div>
<div>And this arose from sorrow without torment,</div>
<div>Which the crowds had, that many were and great,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Of infants and of women and of men.</div>
<div>To me the Master good: 'Why don't you ask</div>
<div>Who these dead dudes you're looking at are?</div>
<div>Let me tell you about these chumps,</div>
<div>They didn't do anything really wrong,</div>
<div>But they could not snap into a Slim Jim</div>
<div>Because the Slim Jim had not yet been discovered;</div>
<div>And if they were before Sim Jims,</div>
<div>In the right manner they adored not jerkey;</div>
<div>They never knew the breakfast of champions.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>As a result, they can't go to heaven,</div>
<div>I am here as well, mostly to mock them</div>
<div>For I did not share my Slim Jims.'</div>
<div>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,</div>
<div>Because some people of much worthiness</div>
<div>I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.</div>
<div>'Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,'</div>
<div>Began I, with desire of being certain</div>
<div>Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,</div>
<div>'Came any one by his own merit hence,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?'</div>
<div>And he, who understood my covert speech,</div>
<div>Replied: 'When I first got here,</div>
<div>When from the sky a long-haired dude appeared,</div>
<div>Almost as glorious as the Nacho Man himself.</div>
<div>He grabbed some Bible dudes, I  think they were</div>
<div>Abe and Abel and Noah's Ark but not Noah,</div>
<div>I think Moses was there too?  It was rad.</div>
<div>There were a bunch of others but honestly</div>
<div>I can't be bothered to remember right now</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>It really isn't important</div>
<div>Past, present, future,</div>
<div>It's the best there is. Ohhhh yeah.</div>
<div>And then that guy left and never came back.</div>
<div>We ceased not to advance because he spake,</div>
<div>But still were passing onward through the forest,</div>
<div>The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.</div>
<div>Not very far as yet our way had gone</div>
<div>This side the summit, when I saw a fire</div>
<div>That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>We were a little distant from it still,</div>
<div>But not so far that I in part discerned not</div>
<div>That honourable people held that place.</div>
<div>'O thou who honourest every art and science,</div>
<div>Who may these be, which such great honour have,</div>
<div>That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'The honourable name,</div>
<div>That sounds of them above there in thy life,</div>
<div>Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.'</div>
<div>In the mean time a voice was heard by me:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>'All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;</div>
<div>His shade returns again, that was departed.'</div>
<div>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,</div>
<div>Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;</div>
<div>Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.</div>
<div>To say to me began my gracious Champion:</div>
<div>'This is a Dude named Dante, and you know me,</div>
<div>The one for whom the sky is the limit.</div>
<div>That one is Andre, Wrestler sovereign;</div>
<div>Next to him is Bubba Rogers, the satirist;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>The third is Roddy, and the last is Albano.</div>
<div>I knew these guys when I was alive</div>
<div>We fought and laughed and ate delicious nachos,</div>
<div>And now we chill for all eternity'</div>
<div>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school</div>
<div>Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,</div>
<div>Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.</div>
<div>When they together had discoursed somewhat,</div>
<div>They turned to me with signs of salutation,</div>
<div>And on beholding this, my Master smiled;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,</div>
<div>In that they made me one of their own band;</div>
<div>So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.</div>
<div>Thus we went on as far as to the light,</div>
<div>Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,</div>
<div>As was the saying of them where I was.</div>
<div>We came unto a noble castle's foot,</div>
<div>Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,</div>
<div>Defended round by a fair rivulet;</div>
<div>This we passed over even as firm ground;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;</div>
<div>We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.</div>
<div>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,</div>
<div>Of great authority in their countenance;</div>
<div>They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.</div>
<div>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side</div>
<div>Into an opening luminous and lofty,</div>
<div>So that they all of them were visible.</div>
<div>There opposite, upon the green enamel,</div>
<div>Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.</div>
<div>I saw Sid Vicious with companions many,</div>
<div>'Mongst whom I knew both Nash and Wright,</div>
<div>Rodman in armour with gerfalcon eyes;</div>
<div>I saw Miss Madness and Madusa</div>
<div>On the other side, and saw Bret Hart,</div>
<div>Who with Pillman his buddy sat;</div>
<div>I saw that The Butcher who drove Sting forth,</div>
<div>And many others who I did not know,</div>
<div>And saw alone, apart, The Repo Man.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>When I had lifted up my brows a little,</div>
<div>The Master I beheld of those who know,</div>
<div>Sit with his slamtastic family.</div>
<div>All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.</div>
<div>There I beheld both Doink and Crush,</div>
<div>Who nearer him before the others stand;</div>
<div>Diesel, who puts the world on chance,</div>
<div>Bart Gunn, Shawn Michaels, and Lex Luger,</div>
<div>Razor Ramon, Mr. Perfect, and Albano;</div>
<div>Of qualities I saw the good collector,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>The Valiant Brothers; and Steele saw I,</div>
<div>Bobo Brazil and Ladd, and The Famous Moolah,</div>
<div>Snuka, Arnold Skaaland, and Rodz,</div>
<div>Kowalski, Patterson, and Morales,</div>
<div>Gorilla Monsoon, who the worst announcer made.</div>
<div>I cannot all of them pourtray in full,</div>
<div>Because so drives me onward the long theme,</div>
<div>That many times the word comes short of fact.</div>
<div>The sixfold company in two divides;</div>
<div>Another way my sapient Guide conducts me</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;</div>
<div>And to a place I come where nothing shines.</div>
<h2>CANTO V.</h2>
<div>Thus I descended out of the first circle</div>
<div>Down to the second, that less space begirds,</div>
<div>And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.</div>
<div>There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;</div>
<div>Examines the transgressions at the entrance;</div>
<div>Judges, and sends according as he girds him.</div>
<div>I say, that when the spirit evil-born</div>
<div>Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;</div>
<div>And this discriminator of transgressions</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;</div>
<div>Girds himself with his tail as many times</div>
<div>As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.</div>
<div>Always before him many of them stand;</div>
<div>They go by turns each one unto the judgment;</div>
<div>They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.</div>
<div>'O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry</div>
<div>Comest,' said Minos to me, when he saw me,</div>
<div>Leaving the practice of so great an office,</div>
<div>'Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee.'</div>
<div>And unto him my Guide: 'Why criest thou too?</div>
<div>Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;</div>
<div>It is so willed there where is power to do</div>
<div>That which is willed; and ask no further question.'</div>
<div>And now begin the dolesome notes to grow</div>
<div>Audible unto me; now am I come</div>
<div>There where much lamentation strikes upon me.</div>
<div>I came into a place mute of all light,</div>
<div>Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>If by opposing winds 't is combated.</div>
<div>The infernal hurricane that never rests</div>
<div>Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;</div>
<div>Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.</div>
<div>When they arrive before the precipice,</div>
<div>There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,</div>
<div>There they blaspheme the puissance divine.</div>
<div>I understood that unto such a torment</div>
<div>The carnal malefactors were condemned,</div>
<div>Who reason subjugate to appetite.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And as the wings of starlings bear them on</div>
<div>In the cold season in large band and full,</div>
<div>So doth that blast the spirits maledict;</div>
<div>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;</div>
<div>No hope doth comfort them for evermore,</div>
<div>Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.</div>
<div>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,</div>
<div>Making in air a long line of themselves,</div>
<div>So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,</div>
<div>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Whereupon said I: 'Master, who are those</div>
<div>People, whom the black air so castigates?'</div>
<div>'Eh, you wouldn't know them really,</div>
<div>They were not macho or rad,' then said he unto me,</div>
<div>'That lady was a real piece of work.</div>
<div>She liked the men if you know what I mean</div>
<div>She made all sex legal all the time,</div>
<div>That way she could have all she liked.</div>
<div>Her name is Semiramis, of Assyria</div>
<div>And I'd like to _Syria_ her _Ass_ one day;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>She was married to Ninus, a macho fellow.</div>
<div>Over there is one you may know,</div>
<div>She's hardcore, strapped asps to her tits;</div>
<div>aka Cleopatra the voluptuous.'</div>
<div>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless</div>
<div>Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,</div>
<div>Who at the last hour combated with Love.</div>
<div>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand</div>
<div>Shades did he name and point out with his finger,</div>
<div>Whom Love had separated from our life.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>After that I had listened to my Teacher,</div>
<div>Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,</div>
<div>Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.</div>
<div>And I began: 'O Poet, willingly</div>
<div>Speak would I to those two, who go together,</div>
<div>And seem upon the wind to be so light.'</div>
<div>And, he to me: 'Cool your jets bro</div>
<div>You can speak to them soon enough, soon enough</div>
<div>They'll come to us looking for love.'</div>
<div>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>My voice uplift I: 'O ye weary souls!</div>
<div>Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.'</div>
<div>As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,</div>
<div>With open and steady wings to the sweet nest</div>
<div>Fly through the air by their volition borne,</div>
<div>So came they from the band where Dido is,</div>
<div>Approaching us athwart the air malign,</div>
<div>So strong was the affectionate appeal.</div>
<div>'O living creature gracious and benignant,</div>
<div>Who visiting goest through the purple air</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,</div>
<div>If were the King of the Universe our friend,</div>
<div>We would pray unto him to give thee peace,</div>
<div>Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.</div>
<div>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,</div>
<div>That will we hear, and we will speak to you,</div>
<div>While silent is the wind, as it is now.</div>
<div>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,</div>
<div>Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends</div>
<div>To rest in peace with all his retinue.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,</div>
<div>Seized this man for the person beautiful</div>
<div>That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.</div>
<div>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,</div>
<div>Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,</div>
<div>That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;</div>
<div>Love has conducted us unto one death;</div>
<div>Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!'</div>
<div>These words were borne along from them to us.</div>
<div>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>I bowed my face, and so long held it down</div>
<div>Until the Poet said to me: 'Whaddaya think?'</div>
<div>When I made answer, I began: 'Alas!</div>
<div>How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,</div>
<div>Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!'</div>
<div>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,</div>
<div>And I began: 'Thine agonies, Francesca,</div>
<div>Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.</div>
<div>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,</div>
<div>By what and in what manner Love conceded,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>That you should know your dubious desires?'</div>
<div>And she to me: 'There is no greater sorrow</div>
<div>Than to be mindful of the happy time</div>
<div>In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.</div>
<div>But, if to recognise the earliest root</div>
<div>Of love in us thou hast so great desire,</div>
<div>I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.</div>
<div>One day we reading were for our delight</div>
<div>Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.</div>
<div>Alone we were and without any fear.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Full many a time our eyes together drew</div>
<div>That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;</div>
<div>But one point only was it that o'ercame us.</div>
<div>When as we read of the much-longed-for smile</div>
<div>Being by such a noble lover kissed,</div>
<div>This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,</div>
<div>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.</div>
<div>Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.</div>
<div>That day no farther did we read therein.'</div>
<div>And all the while one spirit uttered this,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>The other one did weep so, that, for pity,</div>
<div>I swooned away as if I had been dying,</div>
<div>And fell, even as a dead body falls.</div>
<h2>CANTO VI.</h2>
<div>At the return of consciousness, that closed</div>
<div>Before the pity of those two relations,</div>
<div>Which utterly with sadness had confused me,</div>
<div>New torments I behold, and new tormented</div>
<div>Around me, whichsoever way I move,</div>
<div>And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.</div>
<div>In the third circle am I of the rain</div>
<div>Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;</div>
<div>Its law and quality are never new.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,</div>
<div>Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;</div>
<div>Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.</div>
<div>Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,</div>
<div>With his three gullets like a dog is barking</div>
<div>Over the people that are there submerged.</div>
<div>Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,</div>
<div>And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;</div>
<div>He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.</div>
<div>Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>One side they make a shelter for the other;</div>
<div>Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.</div>
<div>When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!</div>
<div>His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;</div>
<div>Not a limb had he that was motionless.</div>
<div>And my Conductor, with his spans extended,</div>
<div>Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,</div>
<div>He threw it into those rapacious gullets.</div>
<div>Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,</div>
<div>And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,</div>
<div>The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed</div>
<div>Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders</div>
<div>Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.</div>
<div>We passed across the shadows, which subdues</div>
<div>The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet</div>
<div>Upon their vanity that person seems.</div>
<div>They all were lying prone upon the earth,</div>
<div>Excepting one, who sat upright as soon</div>
<div>As he beheld us passing on before him.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>'O thou that art conducted through this Hell,'</div>
<div>He said to me, 'recall me, if thou canst;</div>
<div>Thyself wast made before I was unmade.'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'The anguish which thou hast</div>
<div>Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,</div>
<div>So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.</div>
<div>But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful</div>
<div>A place art put, and in such punishment,</div>
<div>If some are greater, none is so displeasing.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Thy city, which is full</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Of envy so that now the sack runs over,</div>
<div>Held me within it in the life serene.</div>
<div>You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;</div>
<div>For the pernicious sin of gluttony</div>
<div>I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.</div>
<div>And I, sad soul, am not the only one,</div>
<div>For all these suffer the like penalty</div>
<div>For the like sin;' and word no more spake he.</div>
<div>I answered him: 'Ciacco, thy wretchedness</div>
<div>Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come</div>
<div>The citizens of the divided city;</div>
<div>If any there be just; and the occasion</div>
<div>Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'They, after long contention,</div>
<div>Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party</div>
<div>Will drive the other out with much offence.</div>
<div>Then afterwards behoves it this one fall</div>
<div>Within three suns, and rise again the other</div>
<div>By force of him who now is on the coast.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>High will it hold its forehead a long while,</div>
<div>Keeping the other under heavy burdens,</div>
<div>Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.</div>
<div>The just are two, and are not understood there;</div>
<div>Envy and Arrogance and Avarice</div>
<div>Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.'</div>
<div>Here ended he his tearful utterance;</div>
<div>And I to him: 'I wish thee still to teach me,</div>
<div>And make a gift to me of further speech.</div>
<div>Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,</div>
<div>And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,</div>
<div>Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;</div>
<div>For great desire constraineth me to learn</div>
<div>If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.'</div>
<div>And he: 'They are among the blacker souls;</div>
<div>A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;</div>
<div>If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.</div>
<div>But when thou art again in the sweet world,</div>
<div>I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>No more I tell thee and no more I answer.'</div>
<div>Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,</div>
<div>Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;</div>
<div>He fell therewith prone like the other blind.</div>
<div>And the Guide said to me: 'He ain't getting up,</div>
<div>Though apparently the bible says something</div>
<div>about the end of days, so maybe then,</div>
<div>I was never really much of a scholar,</div>
<div>but I think it mentioned the dead rising,</div>
<div>Or maybe that was just in Ghostbusters.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture</div>
<div>Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,</div>
<div>Touching a little on the future life.</div>
<div>Wherefore I said: 'Master, these torments here,</div>
<div>Will they increase after the mighty sentence,</div>
<div>Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Man do I look like a prohpet?</div>
<div>Whatever is gonig to happen is going to happen,</div>
<div>And I have no way of knowing which is which.</div>
<div>These folks are trapped here forever</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>They can't get into heaven, so who cares?</div>
<div>It's harsh, but that's how the chips fall.'</div>
<div>Round in a circle by that road we went,</div>
<div>Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;</div>
<div>We came unto the point where the descent is;</div>
<div>There we found Plutus the great enemy.</div>
<h2>CANTO VII.</h2>
<div>'Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!'</div>
<div>Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;</div>
<div>And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,</div>
<div>Said, to encourage me: 'Don't wig out,</div>
<div>We are too macho for this jive turkey,</div>
<div>He can't stop us entering the danger zone.'</div>
<div>Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,</div>
<div>And said: 'Shut up you freakshow;</div>
<div>Why not eat yourself for a change?</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>We got a divine purpose, higher than Nachos;</div>
<div>The big man upstairs sent us so beat it,</div>
<div>We're soaring eagles, you are a slithering snake.'</div>
<div>Even as the sails inflated by the wind</div>
<div>Involved together fall when snaps the mast,</div>
<div>So fell the cruel monster to the earth.</div>
<div>Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,</div>
<div>Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore</div>
<div>Which all the woe of the universe insacks.</div>
<div>Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>New toils and sufferings as I beheld?</div>
<div>And why doth our transgression waste us so?</div>
<div>As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,</div>
<div>That breaks itself on that which it encounters,</div>
<div>So here the folk must dance their roundelay.</div>
<div>Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,</div>
<div>On one side and the other, with great howls,</div>
<div>Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.</div>
<div>They clashed together, and then at that point</div>
<div>Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Crying, 'Why keepest?' and, 'Why squanderest thou?'</div>
<div>Thus they returned along the lurid circle</div>
<div>On either hand unto the opposite point,</div>
<div>Shouting their shameful metre evermore.</div>
<div>Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about</div>
<div>Through his half-circle to another joust;</div>
<div>And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,</div>
<div>Exclaimed: 'My Master, now declare to me</div>
<div>What people these are, and if all were clerks,</div>
<div>These shaven crowns upon the left of us.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And he to me: 'I'll be frank with you dog,</div>
<div>These were the dudes who loved money</div>
<div>And let's be clear, I love money too.</div>
<div>But these guys loved money too much,</div>
<div>And like, not so much in a kinky way either,</div>
<div>But instead they would hurt people to get money.</div>
<div>You might see some churchy folks here</div>
<div>Maybe even a pope or two, and learn:</div>
<div>Even a priest can be a huge dick.'</div>
<div>And I: 'My Master, among such as these</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>I ought forsooth to recognise some few,</div>
<div>Who were infected with these maladies.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'I dunno man, it's sort of dark;</div>
<div>And their dim view of compassion while alive</div>
<div>Makes their forms sort of blurry.  It's weird.</div>
<div>So now they're stuck here forever;</div>
<div>Or until Electronic Arts publishes Dante's Inferno</div>
<div>And they get some cameos in World 4.</div>
<div>I really have no sympathy, neither should you,</div>
<div>They took from others so now their souls are taken;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>There's not much else to say on that matter.</div>
<div>Let me ask you a question buddy,</div>
<div>What do you do with your money? Your wealth?</div>
<div>Are you stingy with it, or do you help others?</div>
<div>Just remember these guys, or maybe Jacob Marley,</div>
<div>Yeah that's right, I know some Dickens</div>
<div>Even literature can be Macho at times.'</div>
<div>'Master,' I said to him, 'now tell me also</div>
<div>What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,</div>
<div>That has the world's goods so within its clutches?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And he to me: 'Look idiot,</div>
<div>Are you not listening or just being dense?</div>
<div>Let me tell you from the beginning, then.</div>
<div>God made everything, obviously,</div>
<div>He made the sky, and the sun, and the stars,</div>
<div>He made the Macho Man and tasty Nachos,</div>
<div>And distributed these Nachos to all creation;</div>
<div>Like a generous dude at a soup kitchen</div>
<div>Where instead of soup they serve Nachos,</div>
<div>But then people wanted MORE NACHOS,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>And would fight over their cheesy goodness,</div>
<div>Warm globes dripping from chips.</div>
<div>So people would fight wars over these things</div>
<div>And that is greed, my macho-in-training,</div>
<div>I was trying to be poetical, it's a metaphor.</div>
<div>And you can't fight greed, because it's nature;</div>
<div>Greed controls the government and church</div>
<div>Money is what drives corruption.</div>
<div>But hey, this is super depressing;</div>
<div>Did you like films by a guy named Herzog?</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>I just the other day watched one.</div>
<div>I'm not one in general for art flicks,</div>
<div>They're just not my speed, but let me say,</div>
<div>I learned an astounding amount about rubber.</div>
<div>Also, are you hot?  It's pretty hot;</div>
<div>I get that this is part of the eternal torment thing</div>
<div>But you'd think that greed's domain would be cooler.</div>
<div>Like, coins are made of metal, and cool to touch;</div>
<div>But now I'm rambling, let us press forward</div>
<div>I... I just was getting a little bored.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>We crossed the circle to the other bank,</div>
<div>Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself</div>
<div>Along a gully that runs out of it.</div>
<div>The water was more sombre far than perse;</div>
<div>And we, in company with the dusky waves,</div>
<div>Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.</div>
<div>A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,</div>
<div>This tristful brooklet, when it has descended</div>
<div>Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.</div>
<div>And I, who stood intent upon beholding,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,</div>
<div>All of them naked and with angry look.</div>
<div>They smote each other not alone with hands,</div>
<div>But with the head and with the breast and feet,</div>
<div>Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.</div>
<div>Said the good Master: 'What you're looking at</div>
<div>Is those folks who were consumed with anger;</div>
<div>REAL anger, not like we pretend in the ring</div>
<div>Their anger is so blazing hot that even now</div>
<div>It makes the very water down there bubble.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>They writhe and spin and boil themselves.</div>
<div>In this jacuzzi, they whine about their lot</div>
<div>They can't take the heat, and unfortunately,</div>
<div>They are not allowed to get out of the kitchen;</div>
<div>So they sing a sad song.</div>
<div>I don't know all the words, but it boils down to,</div>
<div>'Boy it's hot and we are sad, so sad, so sad.''</div>
<div>Thus we went circling round the filthy fen</div>
<div>A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,</div>
<div>With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</div>
<h2>CANTO VIII.</h2>
<div>I say, continuing, that long before</div>
<div>We to the foot of that high tower had come,</div>
<div>Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,</div>
<div>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,</div>
<div>And from afar another answer them,</div>
<div>So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</div>
<div>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,</div>
<div>I said: 'What sayeth this, and what respondeth</div>
<div>That other fire? and who are they that made it?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>And he to me: 'If you look out over the waves</div>
<div>I figure you'll see what's going on</div>
<div>If the view is clear, in any case.'</div>
<div>Cord never shot an arrow from itself</div>
<div>That sped away athwart the air so swift,</div>
<div>As I beheld a very little boat</div>
<div>Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,</div>
<div>Under the guidance of a single pilot,</div>
<div>Who shouted, 'Now art thou arrived, fell soul?'</div>
<div>'Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>For this once,' said my Lord; 'thou shalt not have us</div>
<div>Longer than in the passing of the slough.'</div>
<div>As he who listens to some great deceit</div>
<div>That has been done to him, and then resents it,</div>
<div>Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.</div>
<div>My Guide descended down into the boat,</div>
<div>And then he made me enter after him,</div>
<div>And only when I entered seemed it laden.</div>
<div>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,</div>
<div>The antique prow goes on its way, dividing</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>More of the water than 'tis wont with others.</div>
<div>While we were running through the dead canal,</div>
<div>Uprose in front of me one full of mire,</div>
<div>And said, 'Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'Although I come, I stay not;</div>
<div>But who art thou that hast become so squalid?'</div>
<div>'Thou seest that I am one who weeps,' he answered.</div>
<div>And I to him: 'With weeping and with wailing,</div>
<div>Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;</div>
<div>For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;</div>
<div>Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,</div>
<div>Saying, 'You stay in your place or I will end you.'</div>
<div>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;</div>
<div>He kissed my face, and said: 'Disdainful soul,</div>
<div>Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.</div>
<div>That was an arrogant person in the world;</div>
<div>Goodness is none, that decks his memory;</div>
<div>So likewise here his shade is furious.</div>
<div>How many are esteemed great kings up there,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,</div>
<div>Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!'</div>
<div>And I: 'My Master, much should I be pleased,</div>
<div>If I could see him soused into this broth,</div>
<div>Before we issue forth out of the lake.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Just be patient man,</div>
<div>We'll get there soon enough, you're like a child;</div>
<div>Asking 'are we there yet' from the backseat.'</div>
<div>A little after that, I saw such havoc</div>
<div>Made of him by the people of the mire,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>That still I praise and thank my God for it.</div>
<div>They all were shouting, 'At Philippo Argenti!'</div>
<div>And that exasperate spirit Florentine</div>
<div>Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.</div>
<div>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;</div>
<div>But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,</div>
<div>Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.</div>
<div>And the good Master said: 'See that place?</div>
<div>Dis city here is called Dis, get me?</div>
<div>The people who live there are not macho.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And I: 'Its mosques already, Master, clearly</div>
<div>Within there in the valley I discern</div>
<div>Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire</div>
<div>They were.'  And he to me: 'You're in Hell,</div>
<div>And given that Hell is both full of and on fire,</div>
<div>That red stuff you see is... fire, idiot.'</div>
<div>Then we arrived within the moats profound,</div>
<div>That circumvallate that disconsolate city;</div>
<div>The walls appeared to me to be of iron.</div>
<div>Not without making first a circuit wide,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>We came unto a place where loud the pilot</div>
<div>Cried out to us, 'Debark, here is the entrance.'</div>
<div>More than a thousand at the gates I saw</div>
<div>Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily</div>
<div>Were saying, 'Who is this that without death</div>
<div>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?'</div>
<div>And my sagacious Master made a sign</div>
<div>Of wishing secretly to speak with them.</div>
<div>A little then they quelled their great disdain,</div>
<div>And said: 'Come thou alone, and he begone</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Who has so boldly entered these dominions.</div>
<div>Let him return alone by his mad road;</div>
<div>Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,</div>
<div>Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.'</div>
<div>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted</div>
<div>At utterance of the accursed words;</div>
<div>For never to return here I believed.</div>
<div>'O my dear Guide, who more than seven times</div>
<div>Hast rendered me security, and drawn me</div>
<div>From imminent peril that before me stood,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Do not desert me,' said I, 'thus undone;</div>
<div>And if the going farther be denied us,</div>
<div>Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.'</div>
<div>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,</div>
<div>Said unto me: 'Don't worry, I got you.</div>
<div>God sent us so they can't refuse us.</div>
<div>So just sit tight, watch the Macho Magic,</div>
<div>Take a load off those barking dogs;</div>
<div>I won't abandon you even if you're annoying.'</div>
<div>So onward goes and there abandons me</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,</div>
<div>For No and Yes within my head contend.</div>
<div>I could not hear what he proposed to them;</div>
<div>But with them there he did not linger long,</div>
<div>Ere each within in rivalry ran back.</div>
<div>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,</div>
<div>On my Lord's breast, who had remained without</div>
<div>And turned to me with footsteps far between.</div>
<div>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he</div>
<div>Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>'Who is it that has refused to let us in?'</div>
<div>And unto me: 'I'm really angry now,</div>
<div>But don't worry, I can still handle this,</div>
<div>Their defenses are basically worthless.</div>
<div>They're just acting tough, but it's no use;</div>
<div>There's more than one way to skin a cat,</div>
<div>And more than one way to enter into Dis.</div>
<div>Look around for a stick, or maybe a bomb;</div>
<div>We're going to knock these walls down,</div>
<div>And march over the corpses of these demons,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>That is how the city shall be opened.'</div>
<h2>CANTO IX.</h2>
<div>That hue which cowardice brought out on me,</div>
<div>Beholding my Conductor backward turn,</div>
<div>Sooner repressed within him his new colour.</div>
<div>He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,</div>
<div>Because the eye could not conduct him far</div>
<div>Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.</div>
<div>'We probably should win this fight,'</div>
<div>Began he; 'or else, uh. . .</div>
<div>Let's just not think about that!'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning</div>
<div>He covered up with what came afterward,</div>
<div>That they were words quite different from the first;</div>
<div>But none the less his saying gave me fear,</div>
<div>Because I carried out the broken phrase,</div>
<div>Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.</div>
<div>'Into this bottom of the doleful conch</div>
<div>Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,</div>
<div>Which for its pain has only hope cut off?'</div>
<div>This question put I; and he answered me:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>'Nobody really comes this way,</div>
<div>So honestly it's really hard to say.</div>
<div>A while back I was summoned here</div>
<div>By some shitty wizard named Eric,</div>
<div>Who necromancy'd me against my will.</div>
<div>Though I hadn't been dead for very long,</div>
<div>He sent me on a bogus quest for nachos,</div>
<div>literal nachos, not some catchphrase joke;</div>
<div>Down there into the lowest circle of all,</div>
<div>The furthest from heaven you can get.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Anyway, that's where we're going.</div>
<div>The swamp that we're in now,</div>
<div>Is entirely surrounding the city,</div>
<div>Remember, the one we can't get into.'</div>
<div>And more he said, but not in mind I have it;</div>
<div>Because mine eye had altogether drawn me</div>
<div>Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,</div>
<div>Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen</div>
<div>The three infernal Furies stained with blood,</div>
<div>Who had the limbs of women and their mien,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;</div>
<div>Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,</div>
<div>Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.</div>
<div>And he who well the handmaids of the Queen</div>
<div>Of everlasting lamentation knew,</div>
<div>Said unto me: 'Check out those bird-ladies.</div>
<div>On the left is one named Ozzy;</div>
<div>On the right we have one named Flea;</div>
<div>And in the middle Slash;' and then was silent.</div>
<div>Each one her breast was rending with her nails;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,</div>
<div>That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.</div>
<div>'Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!'</div>
<div>All shouted looking down; 'in evil hour</div>
<div>Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!'</div>
<div>'Oh yeah, you know about Medusa right?</div>
<div>Just close your eyes, bumble around blindly,</div>
<div>Because if you see her it's game over, man.'</div>
<div>Thus said the Master; and he turned me round</div>
<div>Himself, and trusted not unto my hands</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>So far as not to blind me with his own.</div>
<div>O ye who have undistempered intellects,</div>
<div>Observe the doctrine that conceals itself</div>
<div>Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!</div>
<div>And now there came across the turbid waves</div>
<div>The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,</div>
<div>Because of which both of the margins trembled;</div>
<div>Not otherwise it was than of a wind</div>
<div>Impetuous on account of adverse heats,</div>
<div>That smites the forest, and, without restraint,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;</div>
<div>Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,</div>
<div>And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.</div>
<div>Mine eyes he loosed, and said: 'Yo, look over there</div>
<div>that foamy bit down the river can you see?</div>
<div>Over there where it's super smokey.'</div>
<div>Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent</div>
<div>Across the water scatter all abroad,</div>
<div>Until each one is huddled in the earth.</div>
<div>More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Thus fleeing from before one who on foot</div>
<div>Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.</div>
<div>From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,</div>
<div>Waving his left hand oft in front of him,</div>
<div>And only with that anguish seemed he weary.</div>
<div>Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,</div>
<div>And to the Master turned; and he made sign</div>
<div>That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.</div>
<div>Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!</div>
<div>He reached the gate, and with a little rod</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>He opened it, for there was no resistance.</div>
<div>'Hey all you hated people who couldn't get into heaven!'</div>
<div>Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;</div>
<div>'What makes you act so arrogant?</div>
<div>Don't you know you should be humble,</div>
<div>Isn't bad behavior what placed you here?</div>
<div>Don't you ever learn that being bad is bad?</div>
<div>You know that struggling is pointless right?</div>
<div>It's literally impossible to escape from Hell,</div>
<div>So why not chill, shoot some hoops or something?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Then he returned along the miry road,</div>
<div>And spake no word to us, but had the look</div>
<div>Of one whom other care constrains and goads</div>
<div>Than that of him who in his presence is;</div>
<div>And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,</div>
<div>After those holy words all confident.</div>
<div>Within we entered without any contest;</div>
<div>And I, who inclination had to see</div>
<div>What the condition such a fortress holds,</div>
<div>Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>And see on every hand an ample plain,</div>
<div>Full of distress and torment terrible.</div>
<div>Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,</div>
<div>Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,</div>
<div>That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,</div>
<div>The sepulchres make all the place uneven;</div>
<div>So likewise did they there on every side,</div>
<div>Saving that there the manner was more bitter;</div>
<div>For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,</div>
<div>By which they so intensely heated were,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>That iron more so asks not any art.</div>
<div>All of their coverings uplifted were,</div>
<div>And from them issued forth such dire laments,</div>
<div>Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.</div>
<div>And I: 'My Master, what are all those people</div>
<div>Who, having sepulture within those tombs,</div>
<div>Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Those are the Heresiarchs,</div>
<div>And their disciples, dressed in pink.</div>
<div>A bunch more are napping in the crypts.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>A lot of folks here spent their time sleeping;</div>
<div>It's awfully hot and it helps to pass the time.'</div>
<div>And when he to the right had turned, we passed</div>
<div>Between the torments and high parapets.</div>
<h2>CANTO X.</h2>
<div>Now onward goes, along a narrow path</div>
<div>Between the torments and the city wall,</div>
<div>My Master, and I follow at his back.</div>
<div>'O power supreme, that through these impious circles</div>
<div>Turnest me,' I began, 'as pleases thee,</div>
<div>Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;</div>
<div>The people who are lying in these tombs,</div>
<div>Might they be seen? already are uplifted</div>
<div>The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>And he to me: 'Everything will close.</div>
<div>Remember the Book of Revelations?</div>
<div>The dead are going to rise someday.</div>
<div>The seas will churn, and turn to blood</div>
<div>Like some heavy metal album cover,</div>
<div>There's a dragon too, it's awesome;</div>
<div>But as for your question right now,</div>
<div>You'll see the answer soon enough,</div>
<div>And wish you hadn't asked at all.'</div>
<div>And I: 'Good Leader, I but keep concealed</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,</div>
<div>Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.'</div>
<div>'Buddy, we went through a flaming city.</div>
<div>You made it through alive, no mean feat.</div>
<div>So chill a bit, and see what is coming up.</div>
<div>I can tell by the way that you talk</div>
<div>That you and I share a fatherland,</div>
<div>and maybe I've razzed you a bit too much.'</div>
<div>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound</div>
<div>From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.</div>
<div>And unto me he said: 'What are you doing?</div>
<div>Look over there at Farinata the zombie;</div>
<div>Sticking out from the waist up.'</div>
<div>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,</div>
<div>And he uprose erect with breast and front</div>
<div>E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.</div>
<div>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader</div>
<div>Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,</div>
<div>Exclaiming, 'Go talk to him dude!'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb</div>
<div>Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,</div>
<div>Then asked of me, 'Who were thine ancestors?'</div>
<div>I, who desirous of obeying was,</div>
<div>Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;</div>
<div>Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.</div>
<div>Then said he: 'Fiercely adverse have they been</div>
<div>To me, and to my fathers, and my party;</div>
<div>So that two several times I scattered them.'</div>
<div>'If they were banished, they returned on all sides,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>I answered him, 'the first time and the second;</div>
<div>But yours have not acquired that art aright.'</div>
<div>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered</div>
<div>Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;</div>
<div>I think that he had risen on his knees.</div>
<div>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude</div>
<div>He had to see if some one else were with me,</div>
<div>But after his suspicion was all spent,</div>
<div>Weeping, he said to me: 'If through this blind</div>
<div>Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'I come not of myself;</div>
<div>He who is waiting yonder leads me here,</div>
<div>Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.'</div>
<div>His language and the mode of punishment</div>
<div>Already unto me had read his name;</div>
<div>On that account my answer was so full.</div>
<div>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: 'How</div>
<div>Saidst thou,--he had?  Is he not still alive?</div>
<div>Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>When he became aware of some delay,</div>
<div>Which I before my answer made, supine</div>
<div>He fell again, and forth appeared no more.</div>
<div>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire</div>
<div>I had remained, did not his aspect change,</div>
<div>Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.</div>
<div>'And if,' continuing his first discourse,</div>
<div>'They have that art,' he said, 'not learned aright,</div>
<div>That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.</div>
<div>But fifty times shall not rekindled be</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,</div>
<div>Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;</div>
<div>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,</div>
<div>Say why that people is so pitiless</div>
<div>Against my race in each one of its laws?'</div>
<div>Whence I to him: 'The slaughter and great carnage</div>
<div>Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause</div>
<div>Such orisons in our temple to be made.'</div>
<div>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,</div>
<div>'There I was not alone,' he said, 'nor surely</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Without a cause had with the others moved.</div>
<div>But there I was alone, where every one</div>
<div>Consented to the laying waste of Florence,</div>
<div>He who defended her with open face.'</div>
<div>'Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,'</div>
<div>I him entreated, 'solve for me that knot,</div>
<div>Which has entangled my conceptions here.</div>
<div>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,</div>
<div>Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,</div>
<div>And in the present have another mode.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>'We see, like those who have imperfect sight,</div>
<div>The things,' he said, 'that distant are from us;</div>
<div>So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.</div>
<div>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain</div>
<div>Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,</div>
<div>Not anything know we of your human state.</div>
<div>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead</div>
<div>Will be our knowledge from the moment when</div>
<div>The portal of the future shall be closed.'</div>
<div>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Said: 'Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,</div>
<div>That still his son is with the living joined.</div>
<div>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,</div>
<div>Tell him I did it because I was thinking</div>
<div>Already of the error you have solved me.'</div>
<div>And now my Master was recalling me,</div>
<div>Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit</div>
<div>That he would tell me who was with him there.</div>
<div>He said: 'With more than a thousand here I lie;</div>
<div>Within here is the second Frederick,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.'</div>
<div>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards</div>
<div>The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting</div>
<div>Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.</div>
<div>He moved along; and afterward thus going,</div>
<div>He said to me, 'Why are you confused?'</div>
<div>And I in his inquiry satisfied him.</div>
<div>'Let your experience here help you,</div>
<div>against yourself,' that Sage commanded me,</div>
<div>'And now listen up;' and he raised his finger.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>'When we finally reach your hot mama</div>
<div>That lady so fine that the angels swoon,</div>
<div>From her you'll learn all about your own life.'</div>
<div>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;</div>
<div>We left the wall, and went towards the middle,</div>
<div>Along a path that strikes into a valley,</div>
<div>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</div>
<h2>CANTO XI.</h2>
<div>Upon the margin of a lofty bank</div>
<div>Which great rocks broken in a circle made,</div>
<div>We came upon a still more cruel throng;</div>
<div>And there, by reason of the horrible</div>
<div>Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,</div>
<div>We drew ourselves aside behind the cover</div>
<div>Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,</div>
<div>Which said: 'Pope Anastasius I hold,</div>
<div>Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>'Now's the time to take it slow,</div>
<div>It's not very macho, but so it goes</div>
<div>Otherwise we may fall and look silly.'</div>
<div>The Master thus; and unto him I said,</div>
<div>'Some compensation find, that the time pass not</div>
<div>Idly;' and he: 'You really know nothing.</div>
<div>Check out these rocks here, they're gnarly,'</div>
<div>Began he then to say, 'inside are three small circles,</div>
<div>Sort of like the circles that we're leaving now.</div>
<div>They're full of damned souls of course;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>And soon enough you'll see for youself,</div>
<div>And hear their super annoying LAME-O whining.</div>
<div>They've done basically every bad thing,</div>
<div>You name it and they've done it probably,</div>
<div>They lie and cheat and steal and sing.</div>
<div>The ones up here in particular are the liars,</div>
<div>Only humans lie so God hates liars the most,</div>
<div>It's one of the least macho things you can do.</div>
<div>The first circle was the violent of course;</div>
<div>But lots of creatures can hit a dude,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Heck even I, the Nacho Man, have done so.</div>
<div>And God himself uses force on stuff,</div>
<div>Smiting a particularly sinful tree,</div>
<div>Hurling a lightning bolt and a crab.</div>
<div>You can die by violence, or kill,</div>
<div>Or do all sorts of gnarly things to a guy</div>
<div>Ruin, and arson, and straight-up punching;</div>
<div>Homicide, patricide, fratricide, and so forth,</div>
<div>Marauders, and freebooters, everything,</div>
<div>They're all condemned to one circle or another.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Heck you can even inflict violence on yourself</div>
<div>In more ways than one if you know what I mean</div>
<div>And that might get you punished as well</div>
<div>Basically never lay a hand on anybody</div>
<div>Without their consent, or permission,</div>
<div>Otherwise maybe you'll burn forever.</div>
<div>Violence can even be done to God,</div>
<div>Saying rude stuff about him, calling names,</div>
<div>Littering or messing up nature.</div>
<div>In fact, by some measure it can be said</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Literally any action is violent to somebody,</div>
<div>But liars do violence with words alone.</div>
<div>That is why those who commit fraud,</div>
<div>Those who decieve and hoodwink others,</div>
<div>Are probably folks you should not trust.</div>
<div>They have cut themselves off from the macho,</div>
<div>Nature abhors their cunning ways.</div>
<div>The second circle is similar of course,</div>
<div>Hypocrisy, flattery, and sweet wizards,</div>
<div>Falsification, theft, and puppyhaters,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.</div>
<div>They've forgotten things to love in life,</div>
<div>Nature's bounty, a plate of nachos,</div>
<div>All good things from which rad feelings flow.</div>
<div>But it is in this circle, the smallest part</div>
<div>Of the Universe, where Dis is located,</div>
<div>That the betrayers and backstabbers are.'</div>
<div>And I: 'My Master, clear enough proceeds</div>
<div>Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes</div>
<div>This cavern and the people who possess it.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,</div>
<div>Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,</div>
<div>And who encounter with such bitter tongues,</div>
<div>Wherefore are they inside of the red city</div>
<div>Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,</div>
<div>And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?'</div>
<div>And unto me he said: 'Come on bro,</div>
<div>Why do you keep asking these things?</div>
<div>Were you not listening to me at all?</div>
<div>Don't you have any memory whatsoever</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Of all the unethical things that exist</div>
<div>and which heaven itself hold as uncool?--</div>
<div>Incontinence, and Malice, and insane</div>
<div>Bestiality? and how Incontinence</div>
<div>Makes you smell bad, and makes a big mess?</div>
<div>If you think about it for a second,</div>
<div>And remember who are trapped in this place</div>
<div>Those doing penance for their misdeeds,</div>
<div>Surely you'll understand why they're apart</div>
<div>Why their sentences are slightly less painful</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>How Justice has seen to show a bit of mercy.'</div>
<div>'Praise the sun!  For it shines upon those,</div>
<div>Whom you claim to be confused by, no doubt</div>
<div>Having not even bothered to look behind us!</div>
<div>Once more a little backward turn thee,' said I,</div>
<div>'There where thou sayest that usury offends</div>
<div>Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.'</div>
<div>'Think about it,' he said, 'Use your head,</div>
<div>Consider the ways in which one might sin,</div>
<div>And how Nature might deal with you,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>There are a few types of sins;</div>
<div>Did you ever have physics in school,</div>
<div>And looking through a lame-o textbook,</div>
<div>Determine that everything you knew</div>
<div>Was total bogus, entirely worthless;</div>
<div>Such that you just dropped the class?</div>
<div>Try and stir up that feeling</div>
<div>Only think about, I dunno, Eden,</div>
<div>The sort of sins that were commited;</div>
<div>And whether or not blame is assigned,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Or maybe like, read Paradise Lost?</div>
<div>It's written a few centuries after you die.</div>
<div>Anyway, we don't have all day,</div>
<div>We don't need to move slowly anymore,</div>
<div>So let's pick up the pace a bit, yes?</div>
<div>Let's do a sweet trick off this crag here.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XII.</h2>
<div>The place where to descend the bank we came</div>
<div>Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,</div>
<div>Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.</div>
<div>Such as that ruin is which in the flank</div>
<div>Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,</div>
<div>Either by earthquake or by failing stay,</div>
<div>For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,</div>
<div>Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,</div>
<div>Some path 'twould give to him who was above;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Even such was the descent of that ravine,</div>
<div>And on the border of the broken chasm</div>
<div>The infamy of Crete was stretched along,</div>
<div>Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;</div>
<div>And when he us beheld, he bit himself,</div>
<div>Even as one whom anger racks within.</div>
<div>My Sage towards him shouted: 'Is it possible</div>
<div>That you think the Duke of Athens is here,</div>
<div>Who killed you right good long ago?</div>
<div>Get your ugly self out of here, loser.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Else I say something rude about your sister</div>
<div>And then I'll point and laugh at you.'</div>
<div>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment</div>
<div>In which he has received the mortal blow,</div>
<div>Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,</div>
<div>The Minotaur beheld I do the like;</div>
<div>And he, the wary, cried: 'Run to the passage;</div>
<div>While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend.'</div>
<div>Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge</div>
<div>Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.</div>
<div>Thoughtful I went; and he said: 'You're thinking</div>
<div>About how I totally owned that stupid bullman</div>
<div>And how he ran crying before my machoness.</div>
<div>Let me tell you this: the last time</div>
<div>I came through this part of Hell,</div>
<div>This bit hadn't collapsed yet.</div>
<div>And I saw the minotaur dressed up nicely</div>
<div>Leaving his day job in Dis, coming home</div>
<div>Ready to spend the evening with his family,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And I thought maybe he's just like us</div>
<div>Just doing his day job being an evil demon</div>
<div>And comes home to a loving household at night</div>
<div>But then I realize no that's stupid;</div>
<div>He's a crazy bullman with doofy cow horns</div>
<div>And basically nothing makes that not awful.</div>
<div>Anyway, look at that sweet river down there,</div>
<div>It's a river of blood! Super macho!</div>
<div>The folks swimming in it hurt other people.'</div>
<div>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>That spurs us onward so in our short life,</div>
<div>And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</div>
<div>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,</div>
<div>As one which all the plain encompasses,</div>
<div>Conformable to what my Guide had said.</div>
<div>And between this and the embankment's foot</div>
<div>Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,</div>
<div>As in the world they used the chase to follow.</div>
<div>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,</div>
<div>And from the squadron three detached themselves,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>With bows and arrows in advance selected;</div>
<div>And from afar one cried: 'Unto what torment</div>
<div>Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?</div>
<div>Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.'</div>
<div>My Master said: 'We ain't telling you nothin'</div>
<div>We talk to Chrion and nobody but him.</div>
<div>Cry about if if you can't handle it.'</div>
<div>Then touched he me, and said: 'That guy is Nessus,</div>
<div>Who died for the lovely Dejanira,</div>
<div>And took some really gnarly revenge.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And over there through the blood-mist,</div>
<div>You can see Chiron; who trained Achilles</div>
<div>And Pholus who is known for his bad temper.</div>
<div>Thousands of demons stand around the river</div>
<div>Any time a soul tries to escape the blood</div>
<div>They plug him full of arrows! Ka-pow! Wham!'</div>
<div>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;</div>
<div>Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch</div>
<div>Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.</div>
<div>After he had uncovered his great mouth,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>He said to his companions: 'Are you ware</div>
<div>That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?</div>
<div>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.'</div>
<div>And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,</div>
<div>Where the two natures are together joined,</div>
<div>Replied: 'He's alive, it is true</div>
<div>And it is my job to take him through Hell.</div>
<div>This is no pleasure cruise let me tell you.</div>
<div>We're on a mission from God, as it were,</div>
<div>I've got this task direct rom upstairs;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>So we're just going to keep on rolling.</div>
<div>But while I have your attention, let me ask</div>
<div>Given the macho nature of our mission,</div>
<div>And the fact that we have to get through,</div>
<div>Could you lend us one of your centaurs,</div>
<div>Who can let us ride on his back;</div>
<div>This guy isn't a ghost and can't float.'</div>
<div>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,</div>
<div>And said to Nessus: 'Turn and do thou guide them,</div>
<div>And warn aside, if other band may meet you.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>We with our faithful escort onward moved</div>
<div>Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,</div>
<div>Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.</div>
<div>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,</div>
<div>And the great Centaur said: 'Tyrants are these,</div>
<div>Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.</div>
<div>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here</div>
<div>Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius</div>
<div>Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.</div>
<div>That forehead there which has the hair so black</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,</div>
<div>Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,</div>
<div>Up in the world was by his stepson slain.'</div>
<div>Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,</div>
<div>'I have no idea what any of that meant.'</div>
<div>A little farther on the Centaur stopped</div>
<div>Above a folk, who far down as the throat</div>
<div>Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.</div>
<div>A shade he showed us on one side alone,</div>
<div>Saying: 'He cleft asunder in God's bosom</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.'</div>
<div>Then people saw I, who from out the river</div>
<div>Lifted their heads and also all the chest;</div>
<div>And many among these I recognised.</div>
<div>Thus ever more and more grew shallower</div>
<div>That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;</div>
<div>And there across the moat our passage was.</div>
<div>'Even as thou here upon this side beholdest</div>
<div>The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,'</div>
<div>The Centaur said, 'I wish thee to believe</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>That on this other more and more declines</div>
<div>Its bed, until it reunites itself</div>
<div>Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.</div>
<div>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading</div>
<div>That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,</div>
<div>And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks</div>
<div>The tears which with the boiling it unseals</div>
<div>In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,</div>
<div>Who made upon the highways so much war.'</div>
<div>Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</div>
<h2>CANTO XIII.</h2>
<div>Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,</div>
<div>When we had put ourselves within a wood,</div>
<div>That was not marked by any path whatever.</div>
<div>Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,</div>
<div>Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,</div>
<div>Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.</div>
<div>Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,</div>
<div>Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold</div>
<div>'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,</div>
<div>Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,</div>
<div>With sad announcement of impending doom;</div>
<div>Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,</div>
<div>And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;</div>
<div>They make laments upon the wondrous trees.</div>
<div>And the good Master: 'Before we go further,</div>
<div>I want to let you know we're in the second round,'</div>
<div>Thus he began to say, 'and will be, until</div>
<div>We get to the Beach of Gross Sand Crud;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>As we go, look to your sides and you'll see</div>
<div>The proof, if you doubt my macho words.'</div>
<div>I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,</div>
<div>And person none beheld I who might make them,</div>
<div>Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.</div>
<div>I think he thought that I perhaps might think</div>
<div>So many voices issued through those trunks</div>
<div>From people who concealed themselves from us;</div>
<div>Therefore the Master said: 'Why not break off</div>
<div>A little bit of a tree to satisfy yourself?</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Plants don't feel pain, right?  Probably.'</div>
<div>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,</div>
<div>And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;</div>
<div>And the trunk cried, 'Why dost thou mangle me?'</div>
<div>After it had become embrowned with blood,</div>
<div>It recommenced its cry: 'Why dost thou rend me?</div>
<div>Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?</div>
<div>Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;</div>
<div>Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,</div>
<div>Even if the souls of serpents we had been.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>As out of a green brand, that is on fire</div>
<div>At one of the ends, and from the other drips</div>
<div>And hisses with the wind that is escaping;</div>
<div>So from that splinter issued forth together</div>
<div>Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip</div>
<div>Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.</div>
<div>'Oh man, you fell for it, what a dope!'</div>
<div>My Sage made answer, 'Hey tree buddy,</div>
<div>This joker has no idea where he is,</div>
<div>And so I decided to prank him at your expense;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Sorry 'bout that, but it was SO MACHO!</div>
<div>Why don't you tell him who you are?</div>
<div>That way when he leaves for the living world,</div>
<div>Maybe he can tell your ex-wife or something</div>
<div>That he saw you here, and she'll laugh.'</div>
<div>And the trunk said: 'So thy sweet words allure me,</div>
<div>I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,</div>
<div>That I a little to discourse am tempted.</div>
<div>I am the one who both keys had in keeping</div>
<div>Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>So softly in unlocking and in locking,</div>
<div>That from his secrets most men I withheld;</div>
<div>Fidelity I bore the glorious office</div>
<div>So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.</div>
<div>The courtesan who never from the dwelling</div>
<div>Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,</div>
<div>Death universal and the vice of courts,</div>
<div>Inflamed against me all the other minds,</div>
<div>And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,</div>
<div>That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,</div>
<div>Thinking by dying to escape disdain,</div>
<div>Made me unjust against myself, the just.</div>
<div>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,</div>
<div>Do swear to you that never broke I faith</div>
<div>Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;</div>
<div>And to the world if one of you return,</div>
<div>Let him my memory comfort, which is lying</div>
<div>Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.'</div>
<div>Waited awhile, and then: 'If you want to know more,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>The Poet said to me, 'don't waste time,</div>
<div>We don't have all day so ask him now.'</div>
<div>Whence I to him: 'Do thou again inquire</div>
<div>Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;</div>
<div>For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.'</div>
<div>Therefore he recommenced: 'So may the man</div>
<div>Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,</div>
<div>Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased</div>
<div>To tell us in what way the soul is bound</div>
<div>Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>If any from such members e'er is freed.'</div>
<div>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward</div>
<div>The wind was into such a voice converted:</div>
<div>'With brevity shall be replied to you.</div>
<div>When the exasperated soul abandons</div>
<div>The body whence it rent itself away,</div>
<div>Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.</div>
<div>It falls into the forest, and no part</div>
<div>Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,</div>
<div>There like a grain of spelt it germinates.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;</div>
<div>The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,</div>
<div>Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.</div>
<div>Like others for our spoils shall we return;</div>
<div>But not that any one may them revest,</div>
<div>For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.</div>
<div>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal</div>
<div>Forest our bodies shall suspended be,</div>
<div>Each to the thorn of his molested shade.'</div>
<div>We were attentive still unto the trunk,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,</div>
<div>When by a tumult we were overtaken,</div>
<div>In the same way as he is who perceives</div>
<div>The boar and chase approaching to his stand,</div>
<div>Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;</div>
<div>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,</div>
<div>Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,</div>
<div>That of the forest, every fan they broke.</div>
<div>He who was in advance: 'Now help, Death, help!'</div>
<div>And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Was shouting: 'Lano, were not so alert</div>
<div>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!'</div>
<div>And then, perchance because his breath was failing,</div>
<div>He grouped himself together with a bush.</div>
<div>Behind them was the forest full of black</div>
<div>She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot</div>
<div>As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.</div>
<div>On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,</div>
<div>And him they lacerated piece by piece,</div>
<div>Thereafter bore away those aching members.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,</div>
<div>And led me to the bush, that all in vain</div>
<div>Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.</div>
<div>'O Jacopo,' it said, 'of Sant' Andrea,</div>
<div>What helped it thee of me to make a screen?</div>
<div>What blame have I in thy nefarious life?'</div>
<div>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,</div>
<div>He said: 'Hey Bush Buddy, tell us a story</div>
<div>What was your life like?  We're curious.'</div>
<div>And he to us: 'O souls, that hither come</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>To look upon the shameful massacre</div>
<div>That has so rent away from me my leaves,</div>
<div>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;</div>
<div>I of that city was which to the Baptist</div>
<div>Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this</div>
<div>Forever with his art will make it sad.</div>
<div>And were it not that on the pass of Arno</div>
<div>Some glimpses of him are remaining still,</div>
<div>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it</div>
<div>Upon the ashes left by Attila,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>In vain had caused their labour to be done.</div>
<div>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XIV.</h2>
<div>Because the charity of my native place</div>
<div>Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,</div>
<div>And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.</div>
<div>Then came we to the confine, where disparted</div>
<div>The second round is from the third, and where</div>
<div>A horrible form of Justice is beheld.</div>
<div>Clearly to manifest these novel things,</div>
<div>I say that we arrived upon a plain,</div>
<div>Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>The dolorous forest is a garland to it</div>
<div>All round about, as the sad moat to that;</div>
<div>There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.</div>
<div>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,</div>
<div>Not of another fashion made than that</div>
<div>Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.</div>
<div>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou</div>
<div>By each one to be dreaded, who doth read</div>
<div>That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</div>
<div>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Who all were weeping very miserably,</div>
<div>And over them seemed set a law diverse.</div>
<div>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;</div>
<div>And some were sitting all drawn up together,</div>
<div>And others went about continually.</div>
<div>Those who were going round were far the more,</div>
<div>And those were less who lay down to their torment,</div>
<div>But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</div>
<div>O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,</div>
<div>Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</div>
<div>As Alexander, in those torrid parts</div>
<div>Of India, beheld upon his host</div>
<div>Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.</div>
<div>Whence he provided with his phalanxes</div>
<div>To trample down the soil, because the vapour</div>
<div>Better extinguished was while it was single;</div>
<div>Thus was descending the eternal heat,</div>
<div>Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder</div>
<div>Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Without repose forever was the dance</div>
<div>Of miserable hands, now there, now here,</div>
<div>Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.</div>
<div>'Master,' began I, 'thou who overcomest</div>
<div>All things except the demons dire, that issued</div>
<div>Against us at the entrance of the gate,</div>
<div>Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not</div>
<div>The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,</div>
<div>So that the rain seems not to ripen him?'</div>
<div>And he himself, who had become aware</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>That I was questioning my Guide about him,</div>
<div>Cried: 'Such as I was living, am I, dead.</div>
<div>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom</div>
<div>He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,</div>
<div>Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,</div>
<div>And if he wearied out by turns the others</div>
<div>In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,</div>
<div>Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'</div>
<div>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,</div>
<div>And shot his bolts at me with all his might,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.'</div>
<div>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,</div>
<div>That I had never heard him speak so loud:</div>
<div>'Yo Capaneus, aren't you aware that</div>
<div>Your arrogance increases your punishment;?</div>
<div>The only thing making you miserable,</div>
<div>Is yourself.  Chill out bro!'</div>
<div>Then he turned round to me with better lip,</div>
<div>Saying: 'This un-macho rage man here</div>
<div>Was one of seven kings who beseged Thebes</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And also he seems to hate God for some reason;</div>
<div>The only reason he's here is his doing</div>
<div>If he calmed down he could walk on out.</div>
<div>Now follow me, but step lightly here</div>
<div>Don't let your feet touch the grody sand,</div>
<div>Stay close to the woods, understand?'</div>
<div>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes</div>
<div>Forth from the wood a little rivulet,</div>
<div>Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.</div>
<div>As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>The sinful women later share among them,</div>
<div>So downward through the sand it went its way.</div>
<div>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,</div>
<div>Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;</div>
<div>Whence I perceived that there the passage was.</div>
<div>'Out of everything we've seen so far</div>
<div>Since we began this hellish vacation</div>
<div>Has been pretty gnarly, you'll agree</div>
<div>But feast your eyes on this fire-water</div>
<div>Nothing is as rad as this here river,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>With the flames dancing on the surface.'</div>
<div>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him</div>
<div>That he would give me largess of the food,</div>
<div>For which he had given me largess of desire.</div>
<div>'Back on Earth there is this island,'</div>
<div>Said he thereafterward, 'It's called Crete,</div>
<div>And the king there kept his world boring.</div>
<div>On Crete there's this huge old mountain</div>
<div>There are streams and forests and nature stuff.</div>
<div>Nobody lives there, but it's pretty okay.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>The Greeks believed that a goddess gave birth</div>
<div>And hid her son on that island, which I guess</div>
<div>Makes sense because babies are loud and all.</div>
<div>I'm not really sure where I'm going with this</div>
<div>It doesn't have very much to do with the river,</div>
<div>But it somehow seemed like the right thing.</div>
<div>Say, did you know that some guy back on Earth,</div>
<div>Made a video game where I'm a dragon?</div>
<div>It's awesome!  I can breath fire and fly.</div>
<div>Did you bring any food with you at all?</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Ghosts can't really eat you understand,</div>
<div>But it's been so long since I snapped</div>
<div>Into a Slim Jim that I kinda was hoping</div>
<div>Maybe you had one in your pocket somewhere,</div>
<div>And could just pass it through me a bit</div>
<div>So that I can absorb some of the essence.</div>
<div>That's how ghosts eat, like this you see;</div>
<div>Watch 1995's 'Casper', it's in there.</div>
<div>Anyway, this river flows down through Hell.</div>
<div>Eventually it will go to the very bottom</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>But you'll see where, we're going there.'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'If so the present runnel</div>
<div>Doth take its rise in this way from our world,</div>
<div>Why only on this verge appears it to us?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'You know that Hell is circular,</div>
<div>We've come a long way but not long enough,</div>
<div>There's still a long way yet to go,</div>
<div>We haven't made it quite to the end yet.</div>
<div>So if you've been surprised by the sights,</div>
<div>Let me say: You ain't seen nothing yet.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>And I again: 'Master, where shall be found</div>
<div>Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,</div>
<div>And sayest the other of this rain is made?'</div>
<div>'I said nothing of the sort, you buffoon!'</div>
<div>Replied he; 'but to answer your question,</div>
<div>If you look at the water you might know.</div>
<div>See the water there? That's the Lethe,</div>
<div>Sometimes the souls of the punished bathe</div>
<div>And forget why they're here.  It sucks.'</div>
<div>Then said he: 'Alright that's enough for now</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Tourism time is over, we have a schedule;</div>
<div>Let's go this way, follow me across,</div>
<div>I want to get out of this stupid forest.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XV.</h2>
<div>Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,</div>
<div>And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,</div>
<div>From fire it saves the water and the dikes.</div>
<div>Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,</div>
<div>Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,</div>
<div>Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;</div>
<div>And as the Paduans along the Brenta,</div>
<div>To guard their villas and their villages,</div>
<div>Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>In such similitude had those been made,</div>
<div>Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,</div>
<div>Whoever he might be, the master made them.</div>
<div>Now were we from the forest so remote,</div>
<div>I could not have discovered where it was,</div>
<div>Even if backward I had turned myself,</div>
<div>When we a company of souls encountered,</div>
<div>Who came beside the dike, and every one</div>
<div>Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont</div>
<div>To eye each other under a new moon,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>And so towards us sharpened they their brows</div>
<div>As an old tailor at the needle's eye.</div>
<div>Thus scrutinised by such a family,</div>
<div>By some one I was recognised, who seized</div>
<div>My garment's hem, and cried out, 'What a marvel!'</div>
<div>And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,</div>
<div>On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,</div>
<div>That the scorched countenance prevented not</div>
<div>His recognition by my intellect;</div>
<div>And bowing down my face unto his own,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>I made reply, 'Are you here, Ser Brunetto?'</div>
<div>And he: 'May't not displease thee, O my son,</div>
<div>If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini</div>
<div>Backward return and let the trail go on.'</div>
<div>I said to him: 'With all my power I ask it;</div>
<div>And if you wish me to sit down with you,</div>
<div>I will, if he please, for I go with him.'</div>
<div>'O son,' he said, 'whoever of this herd</div>
<div>A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,</div>
<div>Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,</div>
<div>And afterward will I rejoin my band,</div>
<div>Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.'</div>
<div>I did not dare to go down from the road</div>
<div>Level to walk with him; but my head bowed</div>
<div>I held as one who goeth reverently.</div>
<div>And he began: 'What fortune or what fate</div>
<div>Before the last day leadeth thee down here?</div>
<div>And who is this that showeth thee the way?'</div>
<div>'Up there above us in the life serene,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>I answered him, 'I lost me in a valley,</div>
<div>Or ever yet my age had been completed.</div>
<div>But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;</div>
<div>This one appeared to me, returning thither,</div>
<div>And homeward leadeth me along this road.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'If thou thy star do follow,</div>
<div>Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,</div>
<div>If well I judged in the life beautiful.</div>
<div>And if I had not died so prematurely,</div>
<div>Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>I would have given thee comfort in the work.</div>
<div>But that ungrateful and malignant people,</div>
<div>Which of old time from Fesole descended,</div>
<div>And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,</div>
<div>Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;</div>
<div>And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs</div>
<div>It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.</div>
<div>Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;</div>
<div>A people avaricious, envious, proud;</div>
<div>Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,</div>
<div>One party and the other shall be hungry</div>
<div>For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.</div>
<div>Their litter let the beasts of Fesole</div>
<div>Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,</div>
<div>If any still upon their dunghill rise,</div>
<div>In which may yet revive the consecrated</div>
<div>Seed of those Romans, who remained there when</div>
<div>The nest of such great malice it became.'</div>
<div>'If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Replied I to him, 'not yet would you be</div>
<div>In banishment from human nature placed;</div>
<div>For in my mind is fixed, and touches now</div>
<div>My heart the dear and good paternal image</div>
<div>Of you, when in the world from hour to hour</div>
<div>You taught me how a man becomes eternal;</div>
<div>And how much I am grateful, while I live</div>
<div>Behoves that in my language be discerned.</div>
<div>What you narrate of my career I write,</div>
<div>And keep it to be glossed with other text</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.</div>
<div>This much will I have manifest to you;</div>
<div>Provided that my conscience do not chide me,</div>
<div>For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.</div>
<div>Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;</div>
<div>Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around</div>
<div>As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.'</div>
<div>My Master thereupon on his right cheek</div>
<div>Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;</div>
<div>Then said: 'Man, what a downer!'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Nor speaking less on that account, I go</div>
<div>With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are</div>
<div>His most known and most eminent companions.</div>
<div>And he to me: 'To know of some is well;</div>
<div>Of others it were laudable to be silent,</div>
<div>For short would be the time for so much speech.</div>
<div>Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,</div>
<div>And men of letters great and of great fame,</div>
<div>In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.</div>
<div>Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there</div>
<div>If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,</div>
<div>That one, who by the Servant of the Servants</div>
<div>From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,</div>
<div>Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.</div>
<div>More would I say, but coming and discoursing</div>
<div>Can be no longer; for that I behold</div>
<div>New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.</div>
<div>A people comes with whom I may not be;</div>
<div>Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>In which I still live, and no more I ask.'</div>
<div>Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those</div>
<div>Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle</div>
<div>Across the plain; and seemed to be among them</div>
<div>The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</div>
<h2>CANTO XVI.</h2>
<div>Now was I where was heard the reverberation</div>
<div>Of water falling into the next round,</div>
<div>Like to that humming which the beehives make,</div>
<div>When shadows three together started forth,</div>
<div>Running, from out a company that passed</div>
<div>Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.</div>
<div>Towards us came they, and each one cried out:</div>
<div>'Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest</div>
<div>To be some one of our depraved city.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,</div>
<div>Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!</div>
<div>It pains me still but to remember it.</div>
<div>Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;</div>
<div>He turned his face towards me, and 'Now wait,'</div>
<div>He said; 'We need to be nice to these guys.</div>
<div>If it weren't for the fact that we're in Hell</div>
<div>Which is inherently a bad place to be</div>
<div>I'd say that they're swell dudes really.'</div>
<div>As soon as we stood still, they recommenced</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>The old refrain, and when they overtook us,</div>
<div>Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.</div>
<div>As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,</div>
<div>Watching for their advantage and their hold,</div>
<div>Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,</div>
<div>Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage</div>
<div>Direct to me, so that in opposite wise</div>
<div>His neck and feet continual journey made.</div>
<div>And, 'If the misery of this soft place</div>
<div>Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Began one, 'and our aspect black and blistered,</div>
<div>Let the renown of us thy mind incline</div>
<div>To tell us who thou art, who thus securely</div>
<div>Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.</div>
<div>He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,</div>
<div>Naked and skinless though he now may go,</div>
<div>Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;</div>
<div>He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;</div>
<div>His name was Guidoguerra, and in life</div>
<div>Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>The other, who close by me treads the sand,</div>
<div>Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame</div>
<div>Above there in the world should welcome be.</div>
<div>And I, who with them on the cross am placed,</div>
<div>Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly</div>
<div>My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.'</div>
<div>Could I have been protected from the fire,</div>
<div>Below I should have thrown myself among them,</div>
<div>And think the Teacher would have suffered it;</div>
<div>But as I should have burned and baked myself,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>My terror overmastered my good will,</div>
<div>Which made me greedy of embracing them.</div>
<div>Then I began: 'Sorrow and not disdain</div>
<div>Did your condition fix within me so,</div>
<div>That tardily it wholly is stripped off,</div>
<div>As soon as this my Lord said unto me</div>
<div>Words, on account of which I thought within me</div>
<div>That people such as you are were approaching.</div>
<div>I of your city am; and evermore</div>
<div>Your labours and your honourable names</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>I with affection have retraced and heard.</div>
<div>I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits</div>
<div>Promised to me by the veracious Leader;</div>
<div>But to the centre first I needs must plunge.'</div>
<div>'So may the soul for a long while conduct</div>
<div>Those limbs of thine,' did he make answer then,</div>
<div>'And so may thy renown shine after thee,</div>
<div>Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell</div>
<div>Within our city, as they used to do,</div>
<div>Or if they wholly have gone out of it;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment</div>
<div>With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,</div>
<div>Doth greatly mortify us with his words.'</div>
<div>'The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,</div>
<div>Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,</div>
<div>Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!'</div>
<div>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;</div>
<div>And the three, taking that for my reply,</div>
<div>Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.</div>
<div>'If other times so little it doth cost thee,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Replied they all, 'to satisfy another,</div>
<div>Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!</div>
<div>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,</div>
<div>And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,</div>
<div>When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'</div>
<div>See that thou speak of us unto the people.'</div>
<div>Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight</div>
<div>It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.</div>
<div>Not an Amen could possibly be said</div>
<div>So rapidly as they had disappeared;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.</div>
<div>I followed him, and little had we gone,</div>
<div>Before the sound of water was so near us,</div>
<div>That speaking we should hardly have been heard.</div>
<div>Even as that stream which holdeth its own course</div>
<div>The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,</div>
<div>Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,</div>
<div>Which is above called Acquacheta, ere</div>
<div>It down descendeth into its low bed,</div>
<div>And at Forli is vacant of that name,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Reverberates there above San Benedetto</div>
<div>From Alps, by falling at a single leap,</div>
<div>Where for a thousand there were room enough;</div>
<div>Thus downward from a bank precipitate,</div>
<div>We found resounding that dark-tinted water,</div>
<div>So that it soon the ear would have offended.</div>
<div>I had a cord around about me girt,</div>
<div>And therewithal I whilom had designed</div>
<div>To take the panther with the painted skin.</div>
<div>After I this had all from me unloosed,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>As my Conductor had commanded me,</div>
<div>I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,</div>
<div>Whereat he turned himself to the right side,</div>
<div>And at a little distance from the verge,</div>
<div>He cast it down into that deep abyss.</div>
<div>'It must needs be some novelty respond,'</div>
<div>I said within myself, 'to the new signal</div>
<div>The Master with his eye is following so.'</div>
<div>Ah me! how very cautious men should be</div>
<div>With those who not alone behold the act,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!</div>
<div>He said to me: 'Soon what I'm waiting for</div>
<div>Will show up here, and your curiosity</div>
<div>Might be satisfied, for a while.'</div>
<div>Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,</div>
<div>A man should close his lips as far as may be,</div>
<div>Because without his fault it causes shame;</div>
<div>But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes</div>
<div>Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,</div>
<div>So may they not be void of lasting favour,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere</div>
<div>I saw a figure swimming upward come,</div>
<div>Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,</div>
<div>Even as he returns who goeth down</div>
<div>Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled</div>
<div>Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,</div>
<div>Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</div>
<h2>CANTO XVII.</h2>
<div>'Look at that super macho monster down there!</div>
<div>He shatters mountains and breaks city walls!</div>
<div>Check out his power, and be awed!'</div>
<div>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,</div>
<div>And beckoned him that he should come to shore,</div>
<div>Near to the confine of the trodden marble;</div>
<div>And that uncleanly image of deceit</div>
<div>Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,</div>
<div>But on the border did not drag its tail.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>The face was as the face of a just man,</div>
<div>Its semblance outwardly was so benign,</div>
<div>And of a serpent all the trunk beside.</div>
<div>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;</div>
<div>The back, and breast, and both the sides it had</div>
<div>Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.</div>
<div>With colours more, groundwork or broidery</div>
<div>Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,</div>
<div>Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.</div>
<div>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>That part are in the water, part on land;</div>
<div>And as among the guzzling Germans there,</div>
<div>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;</div>
<div>So that vile monster lay upon the border,</div>
<div>Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.</div>
<div>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,</div>
<div>Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,</div>
<div>That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.</div>
<div>The Guide said: 'We should avoid it.</div>
<div>Despite my macho strength and nacho power</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>He is one dude that I don't want to fight.'</div>
<div>We therefore on the right side descended,</div>
<div>And made ten steps upon the outer verge,</div>
<div>Completely to avoid the sand and flame;</div>
<div>And after we are come to him, I see</div>
<div>A little farther off upon the sand</div>
<div>A people sitting near the hollow place.</div>
<div>Then said to me the Master: 'It'll improve</div>
<div>Your experience of Hell immensely,</div>
<div>If you go ask them what their deal is.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>This is not space, but for them, it's the place;</div>
<div>While you do that I'm going to sunbathe,</div>
<div>In this Sahara that is Macho Madness.'</div>
<div>Thus farther still upon the outermost</div>
<div>Head of that seventh circle all alone</div>
<div>I went, where sat the melancholy folk.</div>
<div>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;</div>
<div>This way, that way, they helped them with their hands</div>
<div>Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.</div>
<div>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when</div>
<div>By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</div>
<div>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces</div>
<div>Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,</div>
<div>Not one of them I knew; but I perceived</div>
<div>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,</div>
<div>Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;</div>
<div>And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.</div>
<div>And as I gazing round me come among them,</div>
<div>Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>That had the face and posture of a lion.</div>
<div>Proceeding then the current of my sight,</div>
<div>Another of them saw I, red as blood,</div>
<div>Display a goose more white than butter is.</div>
<div>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid</div>
<div>Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,</div>
<div>Said unto me: 'What dost thou in this moat?</div>
<div>Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,</div>
<div>Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,</div>
<div>Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;</div>
<div>Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,</div>
<div>Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,</div>
<div>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;''</div>
<div>Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust</div>
<div>His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.</div>
<div>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex</div>
<div>Him who had warned me not to tarry long,</div>
<div>Backward I turned me from those weary souls.</div>
<div>I found my Guide, who had already mounted</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Upon the back of that wild animal,</div>
<div>And said to me: 'Now don't be a wuss.</div>
<div>It's time to descend some stairs, get hype!</div>
<div>You ride up front and me in back,</div>
<div>So that you don't get hurt by the tail.'</div>
<div>Such as he is who has so near the ague</div>
<div>Of quartan that his nails are blue already,</div>
<div>And trembles all, but looking at the shade;</div>
<div>Even such became I at those proffered words;</div>
<div>But shame in me his menaces produced,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Which maketh servant strong before good master.</div>
<div>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;</div>
<div>I wished to say, and yet the voice came not</div>
<div>As I believed, 'Take heed that thou embrace me.'</div>
<div>But he, who other times had rescued me</div>
<div>In other peril, soon as I had mounted,</div>
<div>Within his arms encircled and sustained me,</div>
<div>And said: 'Giddyup hoss! Go forth;</div>
<div>It's not every day you carry the Macho Man;</div>
<div>Think of the story you can tell your friends.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,</div>
<div>Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;</div>
<div>And when he wholly felt himself afloat,</div>
<div>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,</div>
<div>And that extended like an eel he moved,</div>
<div>And with his paws drew to himself the air.</div>
<div>A greater fear I do not think there was</div>
<div>What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,</div>
<div>Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;</div>
<div>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,</div>
<div>His father crying, 'An ill way thou takest!'</div>
<div>Than was my own, when I perceived myself</div>
<div>On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished</div>
<div>The sight of everything but of the monster.</div>
<div>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;</div>
<div>Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only</div>
<div>By wind upon my face and from below.</div>
<div>I heard already on the right the whirlpool</div>
<div>Making a horrible crashing under us;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.</div>
<div>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;</div>
<div>Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,</div>
<div>Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.</div>
<div>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,</div>
<div>The turning and descending, by great horrors</div>
<div>That were approaching upon divers sides.</div>
<div>As falcon who has long been on the wing,</div>
<div>Who, without seeing either lure or bird,</div>
<div>Maketh the falconer say, 'Ah me, thou stoopest,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,</div>
<div>Thorough a hundred circles, and alights</div>
<div>Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;</div>
<div>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,</div>
<div>Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,</div>
<div>And being disencumbered of our persons,</div>
<div>He sped away as arrow from the string.</div>
<h2>CANTO XVIII.</h2>
<div>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,</div>
<div>Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,</div>
<div>As is the circle that around it turns.</div>
<div>Right in the middle of the field malign</div>
<div>There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,</div>
<div>Of which its place the structure will recount.</div>
<div>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains</div>
<div>Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,</div>
<div>And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>As where for the protection of the walls</div>
<div>Many and many moats surround the castles,</div>
<div>The part in which they are a figure forms,</div>
<div>Just such an image those presented there;</div>
<div>And as about such strongholds from their gates</div>
<div>Unto the outer bank are little bridges,</div>
<div>So from the precipice's base did crags</div>
<div>Project, which intersected dikes and moats,</div>
<div>Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</div>
<div>Within this place, down shaken from the back</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet</div>
<div>Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</div>
<div>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,</div>
<div>New torments, and new wielders of the lash,</div>
<div>Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</div>
<div>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;</div>
<div>This side the middle came they facing us,</div>
<div>Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</div>
<div>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,</div>
<div>The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</div>
<div>For all upon one side towards the Castle</div>
<div>Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;</div>
<div>On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</div>
<div>This side and that, along the livid stone</div>
<div>Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,</div>
<div>Who cruelly were beating them behind.</div>
<div>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs</div>
<div>At the first blows! and sooth not any one</div>
<div>The second waited for, nor for the third.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>While I was going on, mine eyes by one</div>
<div>Encountered were; and straight I said: 'Already</div>
<div>With sight of this one I am not unfed.'</div>
<div>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,</div>
<div>And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,</div>
<div>And to my going somewhat back assented;</div>
<div>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,</div>
<div>Lowering his face, but little it availed him;</div>
<div>For said I: 'Thou that castest down thine eyes,</div>
<div>If false are not the features which thou bearest,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;</div>
<div>But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Unwillingly I tell it;</div>
<div>But forces me thine utterance distinct,</div>
<div>Which makes me recollect the ancient world.</div>
<div>I was the one who the fair Ghisola</div>
<div>Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,</div>
<div>Howe'er the shameless story may be told.</div>
<div>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;</div>
<div>Nay, rather is this place so full of them,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>That not so many tongues to-day are taught</div>
<div>'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'</div>
<div>And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,</div>
<div>Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.'</div>
<div>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge</div>
<div>A demon smote him, and said: 'Get thee gone</div>
<div>Pander, there are no women here for coin.'</div>
<div>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;</div>
<div>Thereafterward with footsteps few we came</div>
<div>To where a crag projected from the bank.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>This very easily did we ascend,</div>
<div>And turning to the right along its ridge,</div>
<div>From those eternal circles we departed.</div>
<div>When we were there, where it is hollowed out</div>
<div>Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,</div>
<div>The Guide said: 'Wait and look at them,</div>
<div>Those unhip cats who are born evil,</div>
<div>Those whom we have not seen as of yet,</div>
<div>Because they've been following us.'</div>
<div>From the old bridge we looked upon the train</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,</div>
<div>And which the scourges in like manner smite.</div>
<div>And the good Master, without my inquiring,</div>
<div>Said to me: 'Look at the tall one there,</div>
<div>Despite his pain he's standing up tall;</div>
<div>See how macho he remains in its face!</div>
<div>That's Jason, whom you've heard of maybe?</div>
<div>He did some pretty despicable stuff.</div>
<div>I honestly never read Greek myths</div>
<div>So I'm sort of in the dark about this.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>You'll have to do the reading yourself.</div>
<div>Instead, why don't you go bother him?</div>
<div>Ask him about his wife and kids,</div>
<div>And if he ever was a liar to them.</div>
<div>I do know he had a cool boat called the Argo;</div>
<div>I heard he went searching for some mutton,</div>
<div>But then discovered gold was inedible.</div>
<div>Seems like you could learn a lot from him;</div>
<div>About how to be a jerk to women and kids</div>
<div>You know, if you weren't already.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>We were already where the narrow path</div>
<div>Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms</div>
<div>Of that a buttress for another arch.</div>
<div>Thence we heard people, who are making moan</div>
<div>In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,</div>
<div>And with their palms beating upon themselves</div>
<div>The margins were incrusted with a mould</div>
<div>By exhalation from below, that sticks there,</div>
<div>And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.</div>
<div>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>To give us sight of it, without ascending</div>
<div>The arch's back, where most the crag impends.</div>
<div>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat</div>
<div>I saw a people smothered in a filth</div>
<div>That out of human privies seemed to flow;</div>
<div>And whilst below there with mine eye I search,</div>
<div>I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,</div>
<div>It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.</div>
<div>He screamed to me: 'Wherefore art thou so eager</div>
<div>To look at me more than the other foul ones?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>And I to him: 'Because, if I remember,</div>
<div>I have already seen thee with dry hair,</div>
<div>And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;</div>
<div>Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.'</div>
<div>And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:</div>
<div>'The flatteries have submerged me here below,</div>
<div>Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.'</div>
<div>Then said to me the Guide: 'See that thou thrust</div>
<div>Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,</div>
<div>That with thine eyes thou well the face attain</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,</div>
<div>Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,</div>
<div>And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.</div>
<div>Thais the harlot is it, who replied</div>
<div>Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I</div>
<div>Great gratitude from thee?'--'Nay, marvellous;'</div>
<div>And herewith let our sight be satisfied.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XIX.</h2>
<div>O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,</div>
<div>Ye who the things of God, which ought to be</div>
<div>The brides of holiness, rapaciously</div>
<div>For silver and for gold do prostitute,</div>
<div>Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,</div>
<div>Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.</div>
<div>We had already on the following tomb</div>
<div>Ascended to that portion of the crag</div>
<div>Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest</div>
<div>In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,</div>
<div>And with what justice doth thy power distribute!</div>
<div>I saw upon the sides and on the bottom</div>
<div>The livid stone with perforations filled,</div>
<div>All of one size, and every one was round.</div>
<div>To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater</div>
<div>Than those that in my beautiful Saint John</div>
<div>Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,</div>
<div>And one of which, not many years ago,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;</div>
<div>Be this a seal all men to undeceive.</div>
<div>Out of the mouth of each one there protruded</div>
<div>The feet of a transgressor, and the legs</div>
<div>Up to the calf, the rest within remained.</div>
<div>In all of them the soles were both on fire;</div>
<div>Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,</div>
<div>They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.</div>
<div>Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont</div>
<div>To move upon the outer surface only,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>So likewise was it there from heel to point.</div>
<div>'Master, who is that one who writhes himself,</div>
<div>More than his other comrades quivering,'</div>
<div>I said, 'and whom a redder flame is sucking?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'If you follow me a little bit,</div>
<div>Down this bank to where that cat is sitting,</div>
<div>He will tell you himself his sorry story.'</div>
<div>And I: 'What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;</div>
<div>Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not</div>
<div>From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;</div>
<div>We turned, and on the left-hand side descended</div>
<div>Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.</div>
<div>And the good Master yet from off his haunch</div>
<div>Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me</div>
<div>Of him who so lamented with his shanks.</div>
<div>'Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,</div>
<div>O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,'</div>
<div>To say began I, 'if thou canst, speak out.'</div>
<div>I stood even as the friar who is confessing</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,</div>
<div>Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.</div>
<div>And he cried out: 'Dost thou stand there already,</div>
<div>Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?</div>
<div>By many years the record lied to me.</div>
<div>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,</div>
<div>For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud</div>
<div>The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?'</div>
<div>Such I became, as people are who stand,</div>
<div>Not comprehending what is answered them,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.</div>
<div>Then said Macho Man: 'Quick-like, tell him</div>
<div>'That's not me, I'm a different guy!''</div>
<div>And I replied as was imposed on me.</div>
<div>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,</div>
<div>Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation</div>
<div>Said to me: 'Then what wantest thou of me?</div>
<div>If who I am thou carest so much to know,</div>
<div>That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,</div>
<div>Know that I vested was with the great mantle;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And truly was I son of the She-bear,</div>
<div>So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth</div>
<div>Above, and here myself, I pocketed.</div>
<div>Beneath my head the others are dragged down</div>
<div>Who have preceded me in simony,</div>
<div>Flattened along the fissure of the rock.</div>
<div>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever</div>
<div>That one shall come who I believed thou wast,</div>
<div>What time the sudden question I proposed.</div>
<div>But longer I my feet already toast,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>And here have been in this way upside down,</div>
<div>Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;</div>
<div>For after him shall come of fouler deed</div>
<div>From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,</div>
<div>Such as befits to cover him and me.</div>
<div>New Jason will he be, of whom we read</div>
<div>In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,</div>
<div>So he who governs France shall be to this one.'</div>
<div>I do not know if I were here too bold,</div>
<div>That him I answered only in this metre:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>'I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure</div>
<div>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,</div>
<div>Before he put the keys into his keeping?</div>
<div>Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'</div>
<div>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias</div>
<div>Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen</div>
<div>Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.</div>
<div>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,</div>
<div>And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,</div>
<div>Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And were it not that still forbids it me</div>
<div>The reverence for the keys superlative</div>
<div>Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,</div>
<div>I would make use of words more grievous still;</div>
<div>Because your avarice afflicts the world,</div>
<div>Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.</div>
<div>The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,</div>
<div>When she who sitteth upon many waters</div>
<div>To fornicate with kings by him was seen;</div>
<div>The same who with the seven heads was born,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>And power and strength from the ten horns received,</div>
<div>So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.</div>
<div>Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;</div>
<div>And from the idolater how differ ye,</div>
<div>Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?</div>
<div>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,</div>
<div>Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower</div>
<div>Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!'</div>
<div>And while I sang to him such notes as these,</div>
<div>Either that anger or that conscience stung him,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>He struggled violently with both his feet.</div>
<div>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,</div>
<div>With such contented lip he listened ever</div>
<div>Unto the sound of the true words expressed.</div>
<div>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,</div>
<div>And when he had me all upon his breast,</div>
<div>Remounted by the way where he descended.</div>
<div>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;</div>
<div>But bore me to the summit of the arch</div>
<div>Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>There tenderly he laid his burden down,</div>
<div>Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,</div>
<div>That would have been hard passage for the goats:</div>
<div>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</div>
<h2>CANTO XX.</h2>
<div>Of a new pain behoves me to make verses</div>
<div>And give material to the twentieth canto</div>
<div>Of the first song, which is of the submerged.</div>
<div>I was already thoroughly disposed</div>
<div>To peer down into the uncovered depth,</div>
<div>Which bathed itself with tears of agony;</div>
<div>And people saw I through the circular valley,</div>
<div>Silent and weeping, coming at the pace</div>
<div>Which in this world the Litanies assume.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>As lower down my sight descended on them,</div>
<div>Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted</div>
<div>From chin to the beginning of the chest;</div>
<div>For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned,</div>
<div>And backward it behoved them to advance,</div>
<div>As to look forward had been taken from them.</div>
<div>Perchance indeed by violence of palsy</div>
<div>Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;</div>
<div>But I ne'er saw it, nor believe it can be.</div>
<div>As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>From this thy reading, think now for thyself</div>
<div>How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,</div>
<div>When our own image near me I beheld</div>
<div>Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes</div>
<div>Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.</div>
<div>Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak</div>
<div>Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said</div>
<div>To me: 'What are you crying for?</div>
<div>Are you tired?  Is it your bedtime?</div>
<div>It's been a big day for you I know.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>You must be tired and not even know it.</div>
<div>Let me tell you a bedtime story then</div>
<div>To pass the time while we stride forward;</div>
<div>Our macho hair swirling in the breeze.</div>
<div>Once upon a time there was a warrior</div>
<div>Sarnath was his name, from Monqurt</div>
<div>He was a true knight, macho even as me.</div>
<div>When he was young he traveled far</div>
<div>Seeking the best challengers and champions</div>
<div>Besting them all in one-on-one rumbles.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Eventually he came to the land of the Church,</div>
<div>That great cathedral of Amour Lardo,</div>
<div>Where the Cellulite Pope held his court.</div>
<div>Sarnath did not know about religion</div>
<div>In his land there was no church at all,</div>
<div>And of course this world was not our own.</div>
<div>This Nacho Man of old was truly wowed,</div>
<div>The music of the priests blew him away</div>
<div>And the pontiff himself was noble and kind.</div>
<div>For a long time he lived at the court</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Aiding young paladins in their training</div>
<div>Serving as armsmaster for the holy army.</div>
<div>Until finally he took oaths himself,</div>
<div>Not those to be a clergyman, oh no,</div>
<div>But to serve as the shield of the church.</div>
<div>At this time an evil nation to the north,</div>
<div>Wicked and envious of the church's wealth;</div>
<div>Invaded and tried to stamp out the faith.</div>
<div>It was Sarnath who held the line,</div>
<div>Alongside his four most promising pupils,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Who ever after bore the title 'Hounds'.</div>
<div>Their names are famous today</div>
<div>They were Gleeok and Ragnasaurth</div>
<div>Ilthor and strongest of all Thorgan.</div>
<div>With their master they stemmed the tide,</div>
<div>These five alone against a legion of foes</div>
<div>Sheer numbers could not overcome their might.</div>
<div>Yet as the battle appeared to be won,</div>
<div>A single arrow struck Sarnath in the thigh</div>
<div>Fast-acting poison turned his blood cold.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Gasping for air in his final minutes,</div>
<div>Sarnath passed his title on to Thorgan,</div>
<div>Appointing him leader of the Church's army.</div>
<div>Thus ended the story of the hero Sarnath</div>
<div>And where his spirit went I cannot say,</div>
<div>In that world things aren't as simple.</div>
<div>If you don't understand this story,</div>
<div>Don't sweat it, I'm just killing time.</div>
<div>It's actually not that great a story.</div>
<div>And sorry if my speech has become formal</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>During the telling of this particular tale,</div>
<div>I'm just trying to relate it I heard it.</div>
<div>Some guy named Pablo told it to me</div>
<div>When we were lifting at the gym last week,</div>
<div>And I guess it has kind of stuck with me.</div>
<div>Anyway, hopefully this happy tale</div>
<div>Has gotten you to stop crying,</div>
<div>or at least made you fall asleep;</div>
<div>Either way it's the same to me, after all,</div>
<div>We're going to have to keep going eventually</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Unlike you I have all the time in the world.</div>
<div>Say, have I ever tell you the cheese joke?</div>
<div>You know, the one with the goat and the spoon?</div>
<div>Where they end up at the sanitation plant?</div>
<div>Well it's too long to tell now,</div>
<div>There aren't many lines left in this Canto,</div>
<div>But remind me in Canto XXXIV, it's great.</div>
<div>A real knee-slapper let me tell you,</div>
<div>The sort of joke you'll tell your grandkids</div>
<div>Years from now as you munch on a Slim Jim.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And I: 'My Master, thy discourses are</div>
<div>To me so certain, and so take my faith,</div>
<div>That unto me the rest would be spent coals.</div>
<div>But tell me of the people who are passing,</div>
<div>If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,</div>
<div>For only unto that my mind reverts.'</div>
<div>Then said he to me: 'Normally I'd tell you</div>
<div>But I've just spent a lot of time talking</div>
<div>And even ghosts get sore throats, you know.</div>
<div>I know that here there's like six more stanzas</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>And that if I stuck on-script I'd give them all</div>
<div>But honestly I'm just not feeling it right now.</div>
<div>So I'm going to take matters into my own hands</div>
<div>My MACHO hands; my NACHO hands, as they were.</div>
<div>And end this particular canto early.</div>
<div>I hope you don't hold it against me,</div>
<div>The next one is more interesting anyway</div>
<div>So let's just hurry along to it shall we?</div>
<div>Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXI.</h2>
<div>From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things</div>
<div>Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,</div>
<div>We came along, and held the summit, when</div>
<div>We halted to behold another fissure</div>
<div>Of Malebolge and other vain laments;</div>
<div>And I beheld it marvellously dark.</div>
<div>As in the Arsenal of the Venetians</div>
<div>Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch</div>
<div>To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof</div>
<div>One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks</div>
<div>The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;</div>
<div>One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,</div>
<div>This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,</div>
<div>Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;</div>
<div>Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,</div>
<div>Was boiling down below there a dense pitch</div>
<div>Which upon every side the bank belimed.</div>
<div>I saw it, but I did not see within it</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,</div>
<div>And all swell up and resubside compressed.</div>
<div>The while below there fixedly I gazed,</div>
<div>My Leader, crying out: 'Watch out!'</div>
<div>Drew me unto himself from where I stood.</div>
<div>Then I turned round, as one who is impatient</div>
<div>To see what it behoves him to escape,</div>
<div>And whom a sudden terror doth unman,</div>
<div>Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;</div>
<div>And I beheld behind us a black devil,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Running along upon the crag, approach.</div>
<div>Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!</div>
<div>And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,</div>
<div>With open wings and light upon his feet!</div>
<div>His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,</div>
<div>A sinner did encumber with both haunches,</div>
<div>And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.</div>
<div>From off our bridge, he said: 'O Malebranche,</div>
<div>Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;</div>
<div>Plunge him beneath, for I return for others</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.</div>
<div>All there are barrators, except Bonturo;</div>
<div>No into Yes for money there is changed.'</div>
<div>He hurled him down, and over the hard crag</div>
<div>Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened</div>
<div>In so much hurry to pursue a thief.</div>
<div>The other sank, and rose again face downward;</div>
<div>But the demons, under cover of the bridge,</div>
<div>Cried: 'Here the Santo Volto has no place!</div>
<div>Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,</div>
<div>Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.'</div>
<div>They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;</div>
<div>They said: 'It here behoves thee to dance covered,</div>
<div>That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.'</div>
<div>Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make</div>
<div>Immerse into the middle of the caldron</div>
<div>The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.</div>
<div>Said the good Master to me: 'You gotta hide,</div>
<div>So duck down behind this rock face</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And they will not be able to see you;</div>
<div>Don't worry about what happesn to me,</div>
<div>None may withstand the Macho Man unleashed,</div>
<div>I've handled these demons many times.'</div>
<div>Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,</div>
<div>And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,</div>
<div>Need was for him to have a steadfast front.</div>
<div>With the same fury, and the same uproar,</div>
<div>As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,</div>
<div>Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>They issued from beneath the little bridge,</div>
<div>And turned against him all their grappling-irons;</div>
<div>But he cried out: 'Step back idiots!</div>
<div>Do you remember what happened last time,</div>
<div>When I was strolling through on vacation,</div>
<div>And you tried to grab me and paid the price?'</div>
<div>They all cried out: 'Let Malacoda go;'</div>
<div>Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,</div>
<div>And he came to him, saying: 'What avails it?'</div>
<div>'How now, Malacoda? Up for another round?</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>I hope your tail is healed.' my Master said,</div>
<div>'There's a reason your name is evil tail,</div>
<div>But what evil can you do if it breaks again?</div>
<div>Why not let me pass, and spare your body</div>
<div>Unless you're crusing for a bruising.'</div>
<div>Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,</div>
<div>That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,</div>
<div>And to the others said: 'Now strike him not.'</div>
<div>And unto me my Guide: 'O thou, who sittest</div>
<div>Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Securely now return to me again.'</div>
<div>Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;</div>
<div>And all the devils forward thrust themselves,</div>
<div>So that I feared they would not keep their compact.</div>
<div>And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers</div>
<div>Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,</div>
<div>Seeing themselves among so many foes.</div>
<div>Close did I press myself with all my person</div>
<div>Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes</div>
<div>From off their countenance, which was not good.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>They lowered their rakes, and 'Wilt thou have me hit him,'</div>
<div>They said to one another, 'on the rump?'</div>
<div>And answered: 'Yes; see that thou nick him with it.'</div>
<div>But the same demon who was holding parley</div>
<div>With my Conductor turned him very quickly,</div>
<div>And said: 'Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;'</div>
<div>Then said to us: 'You can no farther go</div>
<div>Forward upon this crag, because is lying</div>
<div>All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.</div>
<div>And if it still doth please you to go onward,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Pursue your way along upon this rock;</div>
<div>Near is another crag that yields a path.</div>
<div>Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,</div>
<div>One thousand and two hundred sixty-six</div>
<div>Years were complete, that here the way was broken.</div>
<div>I send in that direction some of mine</div>
<div>To see if any one doth air himself;</div>
<div>Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.</div>
<div>Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,'</div>
<div>Began he to cry out, 'and thou, Cagnazzo;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.</div>
<div>Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,</div>
<div>And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,</div>
<div>And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;</div>
<div>Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;</div>
<div>Let these be safe as far as the next crag,</div>
<div>That all unbroken passes o'er the dens.'</div>
<div>'O me! what is it, Master, that I see?</div>
<div>Pray let us go,' I said, 'without an escort,</div>
<div>If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,</div>
<div>Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,</div>
<div>And with their brows are threatening woe to us?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'There's no need to fear now;</div>
<div>They just want to regain their lost pride,</div>
<div>Gnashing their teeth to shore up their image.'</div>
<div>Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;</div>
<div>But first had each one thrust his tongue between</div>
<div>His teeth towards their leader for a signal;</div>
<div>And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXII.</h2>
<div>I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,</div>
<div>Begin the storming, and their muster make,</div>
<div>And sometimes starting off for their escape;</div>
<div>Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,</div>
<div>O Aretines, and foragers go forth,</div>
<div>Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,</div>
<div>Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,</div>
<div>With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,</div>
<div>And with our own, and with outlandish things,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth</div>
<div>Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,</div>
<div>Nor ship by any sign of land or star.</div>
<div>We went upon our way with the ten demons;</div>
<div>Ah, savage company! but in the church</div>
<div>With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!</div>
<div>Ever upon the pitch was my intent,</div>
<div>To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,</div>
<div>And of the people who therein were burned.</div>
<div>Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>To mariners by arching of the back,</div>
<div>That they should counsel take to save their vessel,</div>
<div>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,</div>
<div>One of the sinners would display his back,</div>
<div>And in less time conceal it than it lightens.</div>
<div>As on the brink of water in a ditch</div>
<div>The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,</div>
<div>So that they hide their feet and other bulk,</div>
<div>So upon every side the sinners stood;</div>
<div>But ever as Barbariccia near them came,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.</div>
<div>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,</div>
<div>One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass</div>
<div>One frog remains, and down another dives;</div>
<div>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,</div>
<div>Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,</div>
<div>And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</div>
<div>I knew, before, the names of all of them,</div>
<div>So had I noted them when they were chosen,</div>
<div>And when they called each other, listened how.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>'O Rubicante, see that thou do lay</div>
<div>Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,'</div>
<div>Cried all together the accursed ones.</div>
<div>And I: 'My Master, see to it, if thou canst,</div>
<div>That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,</div>
<div>Thus come into his adversaries' hands.'</div>
<div>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,</div>
<div>Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:</div>
<div>'I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;</div>
<div>My mother placed me servant to a lord,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>For she had borne me to a ribald knave,</div>
<div>Destroyer of himself and of his things.</div>
<div>Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;</div>
<div>I set me there to practise barratry,</div>
<div>For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.'</div>
<div>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,</div>
<div>On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,</div>
<div>Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.</div>
<div>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;</div>
<div>But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And said: 'Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.'</div>
<div>And to my Master he turned round his head;</div>
<div>'Ask him again,' he said, 'and just maybe</div>
<div>You've noticed I always tell you that.'</div>
<div>The Guide: 'Now tell us of the others here;</div>
<div>Are there any who are worthing hearing about?</div>
<div>Best gnarly story?'  And he: 'I separated</div>
<div>Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;</div>
<div>Would that I still were covered up with him,</div>
<div>For I should fear not either claw nor hook!'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And Libicocco: 'We have borne too much;'</div>
<div>And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,</div>
<div>So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.</div>
<div>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him</div>
<div>Down at the legs; whence their Decurion</div>
<div>Turned round and round about with evil look.</div>
<div>When they again somewhat were pacified,</div>
<div>Of him, who still was looking at his wound,</div>
<div>Demanded my Conductor without stay:</div>
<div>'Wow who was that guy?  I don't know him.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Also you might want to get that looked at.'</div>
<div>And he replied: 'It was the Friar Gomita,</div>
<div>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,</div>
<div>Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,</div>
<div>And dealt so with them each exults thereat;</div>
<div>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,</div>
<div>As he says; and in other offices</div>
<div>A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.</div>
<div>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche</div>
<div>Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.</div>
<div>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;</div>
<div>Still farther would I speak, but am afraid</div>
<div>Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.'</div>
<div>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,</div>
<div>Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,</div>
<div>Said: 'Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.'</div>
<div>'If you desire either to see or hear,'</div>
<div>The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,</div>
<div>'Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>But let the Malebranche cease a little,</div>
<div>So that these may not their revenges fear,</div>
<div>And I, down sitting in this very place,</div>
<div>For one that I am will make seven come,</div>
<div>When I shall whistle, as our custom is</div>
<div>To do whenever one of us comes out.'</div>
<div>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,</div>
<div>Shaking his head, and said: 'Just hear the trick</div>
<div>Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!'</div>
<div>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Responded: 'I by far too cunning am,</div>
<div>When I procure for mine a greater sadness.'</div>
<div>Alichin held not in, but running counter</div>
<div>Unto the rest, said to him: 'If thou dive,</div>
<div>I will not follow thee upon the gallop,</div>
<div>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;</div>
<div>The height be left, and be the bank a shield</div>
<div>To see if thou alone dost countervail us.'</div>
<div>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!</div>
<div>Each to the other side his eyes averted;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>He first, who most reluctant was to do it.</div>
<div>The Navarrese selected well his time;</div>
<div>Planted his feet on land, and in a moment</div>
<div>Leaped, and released himself from their design.</div>
<div>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,</div>
<div>But he most who was cause of the defeat;</div>
<div>Therefore he moved, and cried: 'Thou art o'ertakern.'</div>
<div>But little it availed, for wings could not</div>
<div>Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,</div>
<div>And, flying, upward he his breast directed;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden</div>
<div>Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,</div>
<div>And upward he returneth cross and weary.</div>
<div>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina</div>
<div>Flying behind him followed close, desirous</div>
<div>The other should escape, to have a quarrel.</div>
<div>And when the barrator had disappeared,</div>
<div>He turned his talons upon his companion,</div>
<div>And grappled with him right above the moat.</div>
<div>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>To clapperclaw him well; and both of them</div>
<div>Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.</div>
<div>A sudden intercessor was the heat;</div>
<div>But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,</div>
<div>To such degree they had their wings belimed.</div>
<div>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia</div>
<div>Made four of them fly to the other side</div>
<div>With all their gaffs, and very speedily</div>
<div>This side and that they to their posts descended;</div>
<div>They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>Who were already baked within the crust,</div>
<div>And in this manner busied did we leave them.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXIII.</h2>
<div>Silent, alone, and without company</div>
<div>We went, the one in front, the other after,</div>
<div>As go the Minor Friars along their way.</div>
<div>Upon the fable of Aesop was directed</div>
<div>My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,</div>
<div>Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;</div>
<div>For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike</div>
<div>Than this one is to that, if well we couple</div>
<div>End and beginning with a steadfast mind.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>And even as one thought from another springs,</div>
<div>So afterward from that was born another,</div>
<div>Which the first fear within me double made.</div>
<div>Thus did I ponder: 'These on our account</div>
<div>Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff</div>
<div>So great, that much I think it must annoy them.</div>
<div>If anger be engrafted on ill-will,</div>
<div>They will come after us more merciless</div>
<div>Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,'</div>
<div>I felt my hair stand all on end already</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>With terror, and stood backwardly intent,</div>
<div>When said I: 'Master, if thou hidest not</div>
<div>Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche</div>
<div>I am in dread; we have them now behind us;</div>
<div>I so imagine them, I already feel them.'</div>
<div>And he: 'Sometimes when I hear you speak,</div>
<div>I have no idea what you're saying at all</div>
<div>And so I imagine it's a hilarious joke.</div>
<div>Now, for example, you just said gibberish,</div>
<div>Which I interpreted as a very funny bit</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>About a rooster and a tractor-trailer.</div>
<div>Let's take this downward slope here</div>
<div>Step lively, macho men don't lose balance,</div>
<div>Nothing shall catch us on this path.'</div>
<div>Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,</div>
<div>When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,</div>
<div>Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.</div>
<div>My Leader on a sudden seized me up,</div>
<div>Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,</div>
<div>And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,</div>
<div>Having more care of him than of herself,</div>
<div>So that she clothes her only with a shift;</div>
<div>And downward from the top of the hard bank</div>
<div>Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,</div>
<div>That one side of the other Bolgia walls.</div>
<div>Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice</div>
<div>To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,</div>
<div>When nearest to the paddles it approaches,</div>
<div>As did my Master down along that border,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Bearing me with him on his breast away,</div>
<div>As his own son, and not as a companion.</div>
<div>Hardly the bed of the ravine below</div>
<div>His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill</div>
<div>Right over us; but he was not afraid;</div>
<div>For the high Providence, which had ordained</div>
<div>To place them ministers of the fifth moat,</div>
<div>The power of thence departing took from all.</div>
<div>A painted people there below we found,</div>
<div>Who went about with footsteps very slow,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.</div>
<div>They had on mantles with the hoods low down</div>
<div>Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut</div>
<div>That in Cologne they for the monks are made.</div>
<div>Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;</div>
<div>But inwardly all leaden and so heavy</div>
<div>That Frederick used to put them on of straw.</div>
<div>O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!</div>
<div>Again we turned us, still to the left hand</div>
<div>Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>But owing to the weight, that weary folk</div>
<div>Came on so tardily, that we were new</div>
<div>In company at each motion of the haunch.</div>
<div>Whence I unto my Leader: 'See thou find</div>
<div>Some one who may by deed or name be known,</div>
<div>And thus in going move thine eye about.'</div>
<div>And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,</div>
<div>Cried to us from behind: 'Stay ye your feet,</div>
<div>Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!</div>
<div>Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: 'Wait,</div>
<div>And walk towards this weird duck slowly.'</div>
<div>I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste</div>
<div>Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;</div>
<div>But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.</div>
<div>When they came up, long with an eye askance</div>
<div>They scanned me without uttering a word.</div>
<div>Then to each other turned, and said together:</div>
<div>'He by the action of his throat seems living;</div>
<div>And if they dead are, by what privilege</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?'</div>
<div>Then said to me: 'Tuscan, who to the college</div>
<div>Of miserable hypocrites art come,</div>
<div>Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.'</div>
<div>And I to them: 'Born was I, and grew up</div>
<div>In the great town on the fair river of Arno,</div>
<div>And with the body am I've always had.</div>
<div>But who are ye, in whom there trickles down</div>
<div>Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?</div>
<div>And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And one replied to me: 'These orange cloaks</div>
<div>Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights</div>
<div>Cause in this way their balances to creak.</div>
<div>Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;</div>
<div>I Catalano, and he Loderingo</div>
<div>Named, and together taken by thy city,</div>
<div>As the wont is to take one man alone,</div>
<div>For maintenance of its peace; and we were such</div>
<div>That still it is apparent round Gardingo.'</div>
<div>'O Friars,' began I, 'your iniquitous. . .'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed</div>
<div>One crucified with three stakes on the ground.</div>
<div>When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,</div>
<div>Blowing into his beard with suspirations;</div>
<div>And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,</div>
<div>Said to me: 'This transfixed one, whom thou seest,</div>
<div>Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet</div>
<div>To put one man to torture for the people.</div>
<div>Crosswise and naked is he on the path,</div>
<div>As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;</div>
<div>And in like mode his father-in-law is punished</div>
<div>Within this moat, and the others of the council,</div>
<div>Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.'</div>
<div>And thereupon I saw the Macho Man marvel</div>
<div>O'er him who was extended on the cross</div>
<div>So vilely in eternal banishment.</div>
<div>Then he directed to the Friar this voice:</div>
<div>'We're not lost, but if we were,</div>
<div>Would you tell us if we were going wrong?</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>We're heading down this slope and it seems good,</div>
<div>And the nacho man needs no directions,</div>
<div>No map, but still, you'd let us know, right?'</div>
<div>Then he made answer: 'Nearer than thou hopest</div>
<div>There is a rock, that forth from the great circle</div>
<div>Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,</div>
<div>Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;</div>
<div>You will be able to mount up the ruin,</div>
<div>That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.'</div>
<div>The Leader stood awhile with head held high;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Then said: 'That guy's breath is the worst</div>
<div>I think he ate too many salt and vinegar chips.'</div>
<div>And the Friar: 'Many of the Devil's vices</div>
<div>Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,</div>
<div>That he's a liar and the father of lies.'</div>
<div>Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,</div>
<div>Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;</div>
<div>Whence from the heavy-laden I departed</div>
<div>After the prints of his beloved feet.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXIV.</h2>
<div>In that part of the youthful year wherein</div>
<div>The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,</div>
<div>And now the nights draw near to half the day,</div>
<div>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground</div>
<div>The outward semblance of her sister white,</div>
<div>But little lasts the temper of her pen,</div>
<div>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,</div>
<div>Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign</div>
<div>All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,</div>
<div>Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;</div>
<div>Then he returns and hope revives again,</div>
<div>Seeing the world has changed its countenance</div>
<div>In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,</div>
<div>And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</div>
<div>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,</div>
<div>When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,</div>
<div>And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.</div>
<div>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>The Leader turned to me with that sweet look</div>
<div>Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.</div>
<div>His arms he opened, after some advisement</div>
<div>Within himself elected, looking first</div>
<div>Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.</div>
<div>And even as he who acts and meditates,</div>
<div>For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,</div>
<div>So upward lifting me towards the summit</div>
<div>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,</div>
<div>Saying: 'We've got to climb up there,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>You first, see if it can hold our weight.'</div>
<div>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;</div>
<div>For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,</div>
<div>Were able to ascend from jag to jag.</div>
<div>And had it not been, that upon that precinct</div>
<div>Shorter was the ascent than on the other,</div>
<div>He I know not, but I had been dead beat.</div>
<div>But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth</div>
<div>Of the profoundest well is all inclining,</div>
<div>The structure of each valley doth import</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>That one bank rises and the other sinks.</div>
<div>Still we arrived at length upon the point</div>
<div>Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.</div>
<div>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,</div>
<div>When I was up, that I could go no farther,</div>
<div>Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.</div>
<div>'Don't you fade on me now, pretty boy.'</div>
<div>My Master said; 'Don't you know that</div>
<div>Rest and relaxation makes you soft?</div>
<div>As the kids say today, do you even lift?</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>You need to pump iron and run miles,</div>
<div>Build your body up to a MACHO state.</div>
<div>So get up off of the ground, slacker!</div>
<div>Raise your spirits, act tough!</div>
<div>Don't be a spineless slug, man!</div>
<div>You're going to have to climb more stairs;</div>
<div>This is just the beginning, let me tell you;</div>
<div>If you hear me, then you'll prepare yourself.'</div>
<div>Then I uprose, showing myself provided</div>
<div>Better with breath than I did feel myself,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And said: 'Go on, for I am strong and bold.'</div>
<div>Upward we took our way along the crag,</div>
<div>Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,</div>
<div>And more precipitous far than that before.</div>
<div>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;</div>
<div>Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,</div>
<div>Not well adapted to articulate words.</div>
<div>I know not what it said, though o'er the back</div>
<div>I now was of the arch that passes there;</div>
<div>But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>I was bent downward, but my living eyes</div>
<div>Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;</div>
<div>Wherefore I: 'Master, see that thou arrive</div>
<div>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;</div>
<div>For as from hence I hear and understand not,</div>
<div>So I look down and nothing I distinguish.'</div>
<div>'Don't talk,' he said, 'for a while,</div>
<div>Seriously.  You fill the air with nose</div>
<div>And not the type of madness that I love.'</div>
<div>We from the bridge descended at its head,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,</div>
<div>And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;</div>
<div>And I beheld therein a terrible throng</div>
<div>Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,</div>
<div>That the remembrance still congeals my blood</div>
<div>Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;</div>
<div>For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae</div>
<div>She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,</div>
<div>Neither so many plagues nor so malignant</div>
<div>E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!</div>
<div>Among this cruel and most dismal throng</div>
<div>People were running naked and affrighted.</div>
<div>Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.</div>
<div>They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;</div>
<div>These riveted upon their reins the tail</div>
<div>And head, and were in front of them entwined.</div>
<div>And lo! at one who was upon our side</div>
<div>There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him</div>
<div>There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,</div>
<div>As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly</div>
<div>Behoved it that in falling he became.</div>
<div>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,</div>
<div>The ashes drew together, and of themselves</div>
<div>Into himself they instantly returned.</div>
<div>Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed</div>
<div>The phoenix dies, and then is born again,</div>
<div>When it approaches its five-hundredth year;</div>
<div>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>But only on tears of incense and amomum,</div>
<div>And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.</div>
<div>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,</div>
<div>By force of demons who to earth down drag him,</div>
<div>Or other oppilation that binds man,</div>
<div>When he arises and around him looks,</div>
<div>Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish</div>
<div>Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;</div>
<div>Such was that sinner after he had risen.</div>
<div>Justice of God! O how severe it is,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!</div>
<div>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;</div>
<div>Whence he replied: 'I rained from Tuscany</div>
<div>A short time since into this cruel gorge.</div>
<div>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,</div>
<div>Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,</div>
<div>Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.'</div>
<div>And I unto the Guide: 'Tell him to stir not,</div>
<div>And ask what crime has thrust him here below,</div>
<div>For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,</div>
<div>But unto me directed mind and face,</div>
<div>And with a melancholy shame was painted.</div>
<div>Then said: 'It pains me more that thou hast caught me</div>
<div>Amid this misery where thou seest me,</div>
<div>Than when I from the other life was taken.</div>
<div>What thou demandest I cannot deny;</div>
<div>So low am I put down because I robbed</div>
<div>The sacristy of the fair ornaments,</div>
<div>And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,</div>
<div>If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,</div>
<div>Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:</div>
<div>Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;</div>
<div>Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;</div>
<div>Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,</div>
<div>Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,</div>
<div>And with impetuous and bitter tempest</div>
<div>Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;</div>
<div>When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.</div>
<div>And this I've said that it may give thee pain.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XXV.</h2>
<div>At the conclusion of his words, the thief</div>
<div>Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,</div>
<div>Crying: 'Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.'</div>
<div>From that time forth the serpents were my friends;</div>
<div>For one entwined itself about his neck</div>
<div>As if it said: 'I will not thou speak more;'</div>
<div>And round his arms another, and rebound him,</div>
<div>Clinching itself together so in front,</div>
<div>That with them he could not a motion make.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not</div>
<div>To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,</div>
<div>Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?</div>
<div>Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,</div>
<div>Spirit I saw not against God so proud,</div>
<div>Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!</div>
<div>He fled away, and spake no further word;</div>
<div>And I beheld a Centaur full of rage</div>
<div>Come crying out: 'Where is, where is the scoffer?'</div>
<div>I do not think Maremma has so many</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Serpents as he had all along his back,</div>
<div>As far as where our countenance begins.</div>
<div>Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,</div>
<div>With wings wide open was a dragon lying,</div>
<div>And he sets fire to all that he encounters.</div>
<div>My Master said: 'That guy is Cacus.</div>
<div>It's said that when he was alive</div>
<div>He created a lake of blood. METAL!</div>
<div>He and his brothers are all here together</div>
<div>Because they were thieves and brigands,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>They stole some cows or sheep or something;</div>
<div>They messed with the wrong guy it seems,</div>
<div>Hercules beat them to death with a mace,</div>
<div>It was pretty gnarly if I may say so.'</div>
<div>While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,</div>
<div>And spirits three had underneath us come,</div>
<div>Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,</div>
<div>Until what time they shouted: 'Who are you?'</div>
<div>On which account our story made a halt,</div>
<div>And then we were intent on them alone.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>I did not know them; but it came to pass,</div>
<div>As it is wont to happen by some chance,</div>
<div>That one to name the other was compelled,</div>
<div>Exclaiming: 'Where can Cianfa have remained?'</div>
<div>Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,</div>
<div>Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.</div>
<div>If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe</div>
<div>What I shall say, it will no marvel be,</div>
<div>For I who saw it hardly can admit it.</div>
<div>As I was holding raised on them my brows,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth</div>
<div>In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.</div>
<div>With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,</div>
<div>And with the forward ones his arms it seized;</div>
<div>Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;</div>
<div>The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,</div>
<div>And put its tail through in between the two,</div>
<div>And up behind along the reins outspread it.</div>
<div>Ivy was never fastened by its barbs</div>
<div>Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.</div>
<div>Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax</div>
<div>They had been made, and intermixed their colour;</div>
<div>Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;</div>
<div>E'en as proceedeth on before the flame</div>
<div>Upward along the paper a brown colour,</div>
<div>Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.</div>
<div>The other two looked on, and each of them</div>
<div>Cried out: 'O me, Agnello, how thou changest!</div>
<div>Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Already the two heads had one become,</div>
<div>When there appeared to us two figures mingled</div>
<div>Into one face, wherein the two were lost.</div>
<div>Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,</div>
<div>The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest</div>
<div>Members became that never yet were seen.</div>
<div>Every original aspect there was cancelled;</div>
<div>Two and yet none did the perverted image</div>
<div>Appear, and such departed with slow pace.</div>
<div>Even as a lizard, under the great scourge</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,</div>
<div>Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;</div>
<div>Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies</div>
<div>Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,</div>
<div>Livid and black as is a peppercorn.</div>
<div>And in that part whereat is first received</div>
<div>Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;</div>
<div>Then downward fell in front of him extended.</div>
<div>The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;</div>
<div>Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.</div>
<div>He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;</div>
<div>One through the wound, the other through the mouth</div>
<div>Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.</div>
<div>Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions</div>
<div>Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,</div>
<div>And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.</div>
<div>Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;</div>
<div>For if him to a snake, her to fountain,</div>
<div>Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Because two natures never front to front</div>
<div>Has he transmuted, so that both the forms</div>
<div>To interchange their matter ready were.</div>
<div>Together they responded in such wise,</div>
<div>That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,</div>
<div>And eke the wounded drew his feet together.</div>
<div>The legs together with the thighs themselves</div>
<div>Adhered so, that in little time the juncture</div>
<div>No sign whatever made that was apparent.</div>
<div>He with the cloven tail assumed the figure</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>The other one was losing, and his skin</div>
<div>Became elastic, and the other's hard.</div>
<div>I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,</div>
<div>And both feet of the reptile, that were short,</div>
<div>Lengthen as much as those contracted were.</div>
<div>Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,</div>
<div>Became the member that a man conceals,</div>
<div>And of his own the wretch had two created.</div>
<div>While both of them the exhalation veils</div>
<div>With a new colour, and engenders hair</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>On one of them and depilates the other,</div>
<div>The one uprose and down the other fell,</div>
<div>Though turning not away their impious lamps,</div>
<div>Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.</div>
<div>He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,</div>
<div>And from excess of matter, which came thither,</div>
<div>Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;</div>
<div>What did not backward run and was retained</div>
<div>Of that excess made to the face a nose,</div>
<div>And the lips thickened far as was befitting.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,</div>
<div>And backward draws the ears into his head,</div>
<div>In the same manner as the snail its horns;</div>
<div>And so the tongue, which was entire and apt</div>
<div>For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked</div>
<div>In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.</div>
<div>The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,</div>
<div>Along the valley hissing takes to flight,</div>
<div>And after him the other speaking sputters.</div>
<div>Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>And said to the other: 'I'll have Buoso run,</div>
<div>Crawling as I have done, along this road.'</div>
<div>In this way I beheld the seventh ballast</div>
<div>Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse</div>
<div>The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.</div>
<div>And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be</div>
<div>Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,</div>
<div>They could not flee away so secretly</div>
<div>But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;</div>
<div>And he it was who sole of three companions,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>Which came in the beginning, was not changed;</div>
<div>The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXVI.</h2>
<div>Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,</div>
<div>That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,</div>
<div>And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!</div>
<div>Among the thieves five citizens of thine</div>
<div>Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,</div>
<div>And thou thereby to no great honour risest.</div>
<div>But if when morn is near our dreams are true,</div>
<div>Feel shalt thou in a little time from now</div>
<div>What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>And if it now were, it were not too soon;</div>
<div>Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,</div>
<div>For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age.</div>
<div>We went our way, and up along the stairs</div>
<div>The bourns had made us to descend before,</div>
<div>Remounted my Conductor and drew me.</div>
<div>And following the solitary path</div>
<div>Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,</div>
<div>The foot without the hand sped not at all.</div>
<div>Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>When I direct my mind to what I saw,</div>
<div>And more my genius curb than I am wont,</div>
<div>That it may run not unless virtue guide it;</div>
<div>So that if some good star, or better thing,</div>
<div>Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.</div>
<div>As many as the hind (who on the hill</div>
<div>Rests at the time when he who lights the world</div>
<div>His countenance keeps least concealed from us,</div>
<div>While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)</div>
<div>Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;</div>
<div>With flames as manifold resplendent all</div>
<div>Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware</div>
<div>As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</div>
<div>And such as he who with the bears avenged him</div>
<div>Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,</div>
<div>What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,</div>
<div>For with his eye he could not follow it</div>
<div>So as to see aught else than flame alone,</div>
<div>Even as a little cloud ascending upward,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment</div>
<div>Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,</div>
<div>And every flame a sinner steals away.</div>
<div>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,</div>
<div>So that, if I had seized not on a rock,</div>
<div>Down had I fallen without being pushed.</div>
<div>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,</div>
<div>Exclaimed: 'They're all in the fire there;</div>
<div>They bathe in the fire even though it burns.'</div>
<div>'My Master,' I replied, 'by hearing thee</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>I am more sure; but I surmised already</div>
<div>It might be so, and already wished to ask thee</div>
<div>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft</div>
<div>At top, it seems uprising from the pyre</div>
<div>Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.'</div>
<div>He answered me: 'Some pretty famous guys:</div>
<div>Ulysses and Diomed, the Greek heroes</div>
<div>You probably read about them in high school.</div>
<div>It turns out that making the Trojan Horse</div>
<div>Was weirdly interpreted as a sort of lie</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And so they get to burn in Hell. Oops.</div>
<div>I suspect this plot point has to do</div>
<div>With the fact that Dante was Italian,</div>
<div>So he felt bad about Troy getting sacked.'</div>
<div>'If they within those sparks possess the power</div>
<div>To speak,' I said, 'thee, Master, much I pray,</div>
<div>And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,</div>
<div>That thou make no denial of awaiting</div>
<div>Until the horned flame shall hither come;</div>
<div>Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And he to me: 'Hey, now you're getting it,</div>
<div>Good on you kid, that's the spirit now;</div>
<div>But hold your tongue for one macho minute.</div>
<div>Let me talk for a bit, because I think I know</div>
<div>What you want to hear about, and why that is.</div>
<div>I've been around long enough to guess.'</div>
<div>When now the flame had come unto that point,</div>
<div>Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,</div>
<div>After this fashion did I hear him speak:</div>
<div>'Wubba wubba, magical fire!  Tell me!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>I, the Macho Man, demand of you!</div>
<div>Reveal your secrets!  Tell us stories!</div>
<div>Wumbo wumbo, magical fire!  Tell me!</div>
<div>If you don't help me out right now</div>
<div>I will dump water on you! Beware!'</div>
<div>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,</div>
<div>Murmuring, began to wave itself about</div>
<div>Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.</div>
<div>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro</div>
<div>Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>It uttered forth a voice, and said: 'When I</div>
<div>From Circe had departed, who concealed me</div>
<div>More than a year there near unto Gaeta,</div>
<div>Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,</div>
<div>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence</div>
<div>For my old father, nor the due affection</div>
<div>Which joyous should have made Penelope,</div>
<div>Could overcome within me the desire</div>
<div>I had to be experienced of the world,</div>
<div>And of the vice and virtue of mankind;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>But I put forth on the high open sea</div>
<div>With one sole ship, and that small company</div>
<div>By which I never had deserted been.</div>
<div>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,</div>
<div>Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,</div>
<div>And the others which that sea bathes round about.</div>
<div>I and my company were old and slow</div>
<div>When at that narrow passage we arrived</div>
<div>Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,</div>
<div>That man no farther onward should adventure.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>On the right hand behind me left I Seville,</div>
<div>And on the other already had left Ceuta.</div>
<div>'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand</div>
<div>Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,</div>
<div>To this so inconsiderable vigil</div>
<div>Which is remaining of your senses still</div>
<div>Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,</div>
<div>Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</div>
<div>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;</div>
<div>Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'</div>
<div>So eager did I render my companions,</div>
<div>With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,</div>
<div>That then I hardly could have held them back.</div>
<div>And having turned our stern unto the morning,</div>
<div>We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,</div>
<div>Evermore gaining on the larboard side.</div>
<div>Already all the stars of the other pole</div>
<div>The night beheld, and ours so very low</div>
<div>It did not rise above the ocean floor.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Five times rekindled and as many quenched</div>
<div>Had been the splendour underneath the moon,</div>
<div>Since we had entered into the deep pass,</div>
<div>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim</div>
<div>From distance, and it seemed to me so high</div>
<div>As I had never any one beheld.</div>
<div>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;</div>
<div>For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,</div>
<div>And smote upon the fore part of the ship.</div>
<div>Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,</div>
<div>And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,</div>
<div>Until the sea above us closed again.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XXVII.</h2>
<div>Already was the flame erect and quiet,</div>
<div>To speak no more, and now departed from us</div>
<div>With the permission of the gentle Poet;</div>
<div>When yet another, which behind it came,</div>
<div>Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top</div>
<div>By a confused sound that issued from it.</div>
<div>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first</div>
<div>With the lament of him, and that was right,</div>
<div>Who with his file had modulated it)</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,</div>
<div>That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,</div>
<div>Still it appeared with agony transfixed;</div>
<div>Thus, by not having any way or issue</div>
<div>At first from out the fire, to its own language</div>
<div>Converted were the melancholy words.</div>
<div>But afterwards, when they had gathered way</div>
<div>Up through the point, giving it that vibration</div>
<div>The tongue had given them in their passage out,</div>
<div>We heard it said: 'O thou, at whom I aim</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,</div>
<div>Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'</div>
<div>Because I come perchance a little late,</div>
<div>To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;</div>
<div>Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.</div>
<div>If thou but lately into this blind world</div>
<div>Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,</div>
<div>Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,</div>
<div>Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,</div>
<div>For I was from the mountains there between</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts.'</div>
<div>I still was downward bent and listening,</div>
<div>When my Conductor touched me on the side,</div>
<div>Saying: 'This one is Italian like you.'</div>
<div>And I, who had beforehand my reply</div>
<div>In readiness, forthwith began to speak:</div>
<div>'O soul, that down below there art concealed,</div>
<div>Romagna thine is not and never has been</div>
<div>Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;</div>
<div>But open war I none have left there now.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;</div>
<div>The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,</div>
<div>So that she covers Cervia with her vans.</div>
<div>The city which once made the long resistance,</div>
<div>And of the French a sanguinary heap,</div>
<div>Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;</div>
<div>Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,</div>
<div>Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,</div>
<div>Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.</div>
<div>The cities of Lamone and Santerno</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,</div>
<div>Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;</div>
<div>And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,</div>
<div>Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,</div>
<div>Lives between tyranny and a free state.</div>
<div>Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;</div>
<div>Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,</div>
<div>So may thy name hold front there in the world.'</div>
<div>After the fire a little more had roared</div>
<div>In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:</div>
<div>'If I believed that my reply were made</div>
<div>To one who to the world would e'er return,</div>
<div>This flame without more flickering would stand still;</div>
<div>But inasmuch as never from this depth</div>
<div>Did any one return, if I hear true,</div>
<div>Without the fear of infamy I answer,</div>
<div>I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,</div>
<div>Believing thus begirt to make amends;</div>
<div>And truly my belief had been fulfilled</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,</div>
<div>Who put me back into my former sins;</div>
<div>And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.</div>
<div>While I was still the form of bone and pulp</div>
<div>My mother gave to me, the deeds I did</div>
<div>Were not those of a lion, but a fox.</div>
<div>The machinations and the covert ways</div>
<div>I knew them all, and practised so their craft,</div>
<div>That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.</div>
<div>When now unto that portion of mine age</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>I saw myself arrived, when each one ought</div>
<div>To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,</div>
<div>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;</div>
<div>And penitent and confessing I surrendered,</div>
<div>Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;</div>
<div>The Leader of the modern Pharisees</div>
<div>Having a war near unto Lateran,</div>
<div>And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,</div>
<div>For each one of his enemies was Christian,</div>
<div>And none of them had been to conquer Acre,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,</div>
<div>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,</div>
<div>In him regarded, nor in me that cord</div>
<div>Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;</div>
<div>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester</div>
<div>To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,</div>
<div>So this one sought me out as an adept</div>
<div>To cure him of the fever of his pride.</div>
<div>Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,</div>
<div>Because his words appeared inebriate.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;</div>
<div>Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me</div>
<div>How to raze Palestrina to the ground.</div>
<div>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,</div>
<div>As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,</div>
<div>The which my predecessor held not dear.'</div>
<div>Then urged me on his weighty arguments</div>
<div>There, where my silence was the worst advice;</div>
<div>And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me</div>
<div>Of that sin into which I now must fall,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>The promise long with the fulfilment short</div>
<div>Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'</div>
<div>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,</div>
<div>For me; but one of the black Cherubim</div>
<div>Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;</div>
<div>He must come down among my servitors,</div>
<div>Because he gave the fraudulent advice</div>
<div>From which time forth I have been at his hair;</div>
<div>For who repents not cannot be absolved,</div>
<div>Nor can one both repent and will at once,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Because of the contradiction which consents not.'</div>
<div>O miserable me! how I did shudder</div>
<div>When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure</div>
<div>Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'</div>
<div>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined</div>
<div>Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,</div>
<div>And after he had bitten it in great rage,</div>
<div>Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'</div>
<div>Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,</div>
<div>And vested thus in going I bemoan me.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>When it had thus completed its recital,</div>
<div>The flame departed uttering lamentations,</div>
<div>Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.</div>
<div>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,</div>
<div>Up o'er the crag above another arch,</div>
<div>Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee</div>
<div>By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXVIII.</h2>
<div>Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words,</div>
<div>Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full</div>
<div>Which now I saw, by many times narrating?</div>
<div>Each tongue would for a certainty fall short</div>
<div>By reason of our speech and memory,</div>
<div>That have small room to comprehend so much.</div>
<div>If were again assembled all the people</div>
<div>Which formerly upon the fateful land</div>
<div>Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Shed by the Romans and the lingering war</div>
<div>That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,</div>
<div>As Livy has recorded, who errs not,</div>
<div>With those who felt the agony of blows</div>
<div>By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,</div>
<div>And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still</div>
<div>At Ceperano, where a renegade</div>
<div>Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,</div>
<div>Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,</div>
<div>And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Should show, it would be nothing to compare</div>
<div>With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.</div>
<div>A cask by losing centre-piece or cant</div>
<div>Was never shattered so, as I saw one</div>
<div>Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.</div>
<div>Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;</div>
<div>His heart was visible, and the dismal sack</div>
<div>That maketh excrement of what is eaten.</div>
<div>While I was all absorbed in seeing him,</div>
<div>He looked at me, and opened with his hands</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>His bosom, saying: 'See now how I rend me;</div>
<div>How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;</div>
<div>In front of me doth Ali weeping go,</div>
<div>Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;</div>
<div>And all the others whom thou here beholdest,</div>
<div>Disseminators of scandal and of schism</div>
<div>While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.</div>
<div>A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us</div>
<div>Thus cruelly, unto the falchion's edge</div>
<div>Putting again each one of all this ream,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>When we have gone around the doleful road;</div>
<div>By reason that our wounds are closed again</div>
<div>Ere any one in front of him repass.</div>
<div>But who art thou, that musest on the crag,</div>
<div>Perchance to postpone going to the pain</div>
<div>That is adjudged upon thine accusations?'</div>
<div>'He's not dead yet, and he's not a sinner,'</div>
<div>My Master made reply, 'here for punishment;</div>
<div>He's just here for the sightseeing.</div>
<div>I, on the other hand, am dead, his guide.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>I'm showing him the ropes of the place;</div>
<div>Because God asked me to do this favor.'</div>
<div>More than a hundred were there when they heard him,</div>
<div>Who in the moat stood still to look at me,</div>
<div>Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.</div>
<div>'Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,</div>
<div>Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,</div>
<div>If soon he wish not here to follow me,</div>
<div>So with provisions, that no stress of snow</div>
<div>May give the victory to the Novarese,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Which otherwise to gain would not be easy.'</div>
<div>After one foot to go away he lifted,</div>
<div>This word did Mahomet say unto me,</div>
<div>Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.</div>
<div>Another one, who had his throat pierced through,</div>
<div>And nose cut off close underneath the brows,</div>
<div>And had no longer but a single ear,</div>
<div>Staying to look in wonder with the others,</div>
<div>Before the others did his gullet open,</div>
<div>Which outwardly was red in every part,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And said: 'O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,</div>
<div>And whom I once saw up in Latian land,</div>
<div>Unless too great similitude deceive me,</div>
<div>Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,</div>
<div>If e'er thou see again the lovely plain</div>
<div>That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,</div>
<div>And make it known to the best two of Fano,</div>
<div>To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,</div>
<div>That if foreseeing here be not in vain,</div>
<div>Cast over from their vessel shall they be,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>And drowned near unto the Cattolica,</div>
<div>By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.</div>
<div>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca</div>
<div>Neptune ne'er yet beheld so great a crime,</div>
<div>Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.</div>
<div>That traitor, who sees only with one eye,</div>
<div>And holds the land, which some one here with me</div>
<div>Would fain be fasting from the vision of,</div>
<div>Will make them come unto a parley with him;</div>
<div>Then will do so, that to Focara's wind</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'Show to me and declare,</div>
<div>If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,</div>
<div>Who is this person of the bitter vision.'</div>
<div>Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw</div>
<div>Of one of his companions, and his mouth</div>
<div>Oped, crying: 'This is he, and he speaks not.</div>
<div>This one, being banished, every doubt submerged</div>
<div>In Caesar by affirming the forearmed</div>
<div>Always with detriment allowed delay.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>O how bewildered unto me appeared,</div>
<div>With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,</div>
<div>Curio, who in speaking was so bold!</div>
<div>And one, who both his hands dissevered had,</div>
<div>The stumps uplifting through the murky air,</div>
<div>So that the blood made horrible his face,</div>
<div>Cried out: 'Thou shalt remember Mosca also,</div>
<div>Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!'</div>
<div>Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people.'</div>
<div>'And death unto thy race,' thereto I added;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,</div>
<div>Departed, like a person sad and crazed.</div>
<div>But I remained to look upon the crowd;</div>
<div>And saw a thing which I should be afraid,</div>
<div>Without some further proof, even to recount,</div>
<div>If it were not that conscience reassures me,</div>
<div>That good companion which emboldens man</div>
<div>Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.</div>
<div>I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,</div>
<div>A trunk without a head walk in like manner</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>As walked the others of the mournful herd.</div>
<div>And by the hair it held the head dissevered,</div>
<div>Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,</div>
<div>And that upon us gazed and said: 'O me!'</div>
<div>It of itself made to itself a lamp,</div>
<div>And they were two in one, and one in two;</div>
<div>How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.</div>
<div>When it was come close to the bridge's foot,</div>
<div>It lifted high its arm with all the head,</div>
<div>To bring more closely unto us its words,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Which were: 'Behold now the sore penalty,</div>
<div>Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;</div>
<div>Behold if any be as great as this.</div>
<div>And so that thou may carry news of me,</div>
<div>Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same</div>
<div>Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.</div>
<div>I made the father and the son rebellious;</div>
<div>Achitophel not more with Absalom</div>
<div>And David did with his accursed goadings.</div>
<div>Because I parted persons so united,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!</div>
<div>From its beginning, which is in this trunk.</div>
<div>Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XXIX.</h2>
<div>The many people and the divers wounds</div>
<div>These eyes of mine had so inebriated,</div>
<div>That they were wishful to stand still and weep;</div>
<div>But said Randius: 'What are you still looking at?</div>
<div>What is there possibly of interest</div>
<div>Down in the writhing ghost-men?</div>
<div>You never stared like this before now;</div>
<div>We still have a long road to walk,</div>
<div>Twenty-two miles yet to go! Hurry!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>It's already past midnright! See the moon?</div>
<div>We have only a short amount of time left,</div>
<div>So come on buckaroo, we gotta jet.'</div>
<div>'If thou hadst,' I made answer thereupon,</div>
<div>'Attended to the cause for which I looked,</div>
<div>Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.'</div>
<div>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him</div>
<div>I went, already making my reply,</div>
<div>And superadding: 'In that cavern where</div>
<div>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>I think a spirit of my blood laments</div>
<div>The sin which down below there costs so much.'</div>
<div>Then said the Master: 'Don't think about it.</div>
<div>Keep your eyes on the prize and move on;</div>
<div>He isn't going anywhere, and you are;</div>
<div>That is one of the advantages of being alive,</div>
<div>You get to go to other places than this one</div>
<div>And don't have to be stuck in one location.</div>
<div>Just think of the places you could go!</div>
<div>Albania, Morocco, Thailand, Space. Space!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>You could go to Space!  Space is the place.'</div>
<div>'O my Conductor, his own violent death,</div>
<div>Which is not yet avenged for him,' I said,</div>
<div>'By any who is sharer in the shame,</div>
<div>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,</div>
<div>As I imagine, without speaking to me,</div>
<div>And thereby made me pity him the more.'</div>
<div>Thus did we speak as far as the first place</div>
<div>Upon the crag, which the next valley shows</div>
<div>Down to the bottom, if there were more light.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>When we were now right over the last cloister</div>
<div>Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers</div>
<div>Could manifest themselves unto our sight,</div>
<div>Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,</div>
<div>Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,</div>
<div>Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.</div>
<div>What pain would be, if from the hospitals</div>
<div>Of Valdichiana, 'twixt July and September,</div>
<div>And of Maremma and Sardinia</div>
<div>All the diseases in one moat were gathered,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Such was it here, and such a stench came from it</div>
<div>As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.</div>
<div>We had descended on the furthest bank</div>
<div>From the long crag, upon the left hand still,</div>
<div>And then more vivid was my power of sight</div>
<div>Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress</div>
<div>Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,</div>
<div>Punishes forgers, which she here records.</div>
<div>I do not think a sadder sight to see</div>
<div>Was in Aegina the whole people sick,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>(When was the air so full of pestilence,</div>
<div>The animals, down to the little worm,</div>
<div>All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,</div>
<div>According as the poets have affirmed,</div>
<div>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)</div>
<div>Than was it to behold through that dark valley</div>
<div>The spirits languishing in divers heaps.</div>
<div>This on the belly, that upon the back</div>
<div>One of the other lay, and others crawling</div>
<div>Shifted themselves along the dismal road.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>We step by step went onward without speech,</div>
<div>Gazing upon and listening to the sick</div>
<div>Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.</div>
<div>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,</div>
<div>As leans in heating platter against platter,</div>
<div>From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;</div>
<div>And never saw I plied a currycomb</div>
<div>By stable-boy for whom his master waits,</div>
<div>Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,</div>
<div>As every one was plying fast the bite</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Of nails upon himself, for the great rage</div>
<div>Of itching which no other succour had.</div>
<div>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,</div>
<div>In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,</div>
<div>Or any other fish that has them largest.</div>
<div>'Hey you!  Yeah, yous with the fingers,'</div>
<div>Began my Leader unto one of them,</div>
<div>'The finger-guys who pinch sometimes,</div>
<div>Are any of you Italians by chance?</div>
<div>My buddy here likes talking to Italians,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Not that he's racist or anything.'</div>
<div>'Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,</div>
<div>Both of us here,' one weeping made reply;</div>
<div>'But who art thou, that questionest about us?'</div>
<div>And said the Guide: 'I am the Macho Man!</div>
<div>With boldness I leap from cliff to cliff,</div>
<div>And I intend to show Hell to this guy.'</div>
<div>Then broken was their mutual support,</div>
<div>And trembling each one turned himself to me,</div>
<div>With others who had heard him by rebound.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,</div>
<div>Saying: 'Now you can talk to them.'</div>
<div>And I began, since he would have it so:</div>
<div>'So may your memory not steal away</div>
<div>In the first world from out the minds of men,</div>
<div>But so may it survive 'neath many suns,</div>
<div>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;</div>
<div>Let not your foul and loathsome punishment</div>
<div>Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.'</div>
<div>'I of Arezzo was,' one made reply,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>'And Albert of Siena had me burned;</div>
<div>But what I died for does not bring me here.</div>
<div>'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,</div>
<div>That I could rise by flight into the air,</div>
<div>And he who had conceit, but little wit,</div>
<div>Would have me show to him the art; and only</div>
<div>Because no Daedalus I made him, made me</div>
<div>Be burned by one who held him as his son.</div>
<div>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,</div>
<div>For alchemy, which in the world I practised,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.'</div>
<div>And to the Poet said I: 'Now was ever</div>
<div>So vain a people as the Sienese?</div>
<div>Not for a certainty the French by far.'</div>
<div>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,</div>
<div>Replied unto my speech: 'Taking out Stricca,</div>
<div>Who knew the art of moderate expenses,</div>
<div>And Niccolo, who the luxurious use</div>
<div>Of cloves discovered earliest of all</div>
<div>Within that garden where such seed takes root;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>And taking out the band, among whom squandered</div>
<div>Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,</div>
<div>And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!</div>
<div>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee</div>
<div>Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye</div>
<div>Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,</div>
<div>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,</div>
<div>Who metals falsified by alchemy;</div>
<div>Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,</div>
<div>How I a skilful ape of nature was.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XXX.</h2>
<div>'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,</div>
<div>For Semele, against the Theban blood,</div>
<div>As she already more than once had shown,</div>
<div>So reft of reason Athamas became,</div>
<div>That, seeing his own wife with children twain</div>
<div>Walking encumbered upon either hand,</div>
<div>He cried: 'Spread out the nets, that I may take</div>
<div>The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;'</div>
<div>And then extended his unpitying claws,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,</div>
<div>And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;</div>
<div>And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;--</div>
<div>And at the time when fortune downward hurled</div>
<div>The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared,</div>
<div>So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,</div>
<div>Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,</div>
<div>When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,</div>
<div>And of her Polydorus on the shore</div>
<div>Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Out of her senses like a dog she barked,</div>
<div>So much the anguish had her mind distorted;</div>
<div>But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan</div>
<div>Were ever seen in any one so cruel</div>
<div>In goading beasts, and much more human members,</div>
<div>As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,</div>
<div>Who, biting, in the manner ran along</div>
<div>That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.</div>
<div>One to Capocchio came, and by the nape</div>
<div>Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</div>
<div>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,</div>
<div>Said to me: 'That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,</div>
<div>And raving goes thus harrying other people.'</div>
<div>'O,' said I to him, 'so may not the other</div>
<div>Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee</div>
<div>To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'That is the ancient ghost</div>
<div>Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became</div>
<div>Beyond all rightful love her father's lover.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>She came to sin with him after this manner,</div>
<div>By counterfeiting of another's form;</div>
<div>As he who goeth yonder undertook,</div>
<div>That he might gain the lady of the herd,</div>
<div>To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,</div>
<div>Making a will and giving it due form.'</div>
<div>And after the two maniacs had passed</div>
<div>On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back</div>
<div>To look upon the other evil-born.</div>
<div>I saw one made in fashion of a lute,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>If he had only had the groin cut off</div>
<div>Just at the point at which a man is forked.</div>
<div>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions</div>
<div>The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,</div>
<div>That the face corresponds not to the belly,</div>
<div>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart</div>
<div>As does the hectic, who because of thirst</div>
<div>One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns.</div>
<div>'O ye, who without any torment are,</div>
<div>And why I know not, in the world of woe,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>He said to us, 'behold, and be attentive</div>
<div>Unto the misery of Master Adam;</div>
<div>I had while living much of what I wished,</div>
<div>And now, alas! a drop of water crave.</div>
<div>The rivulets, that from the verdant hills</div>
<div>Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,</div>
<div>Making their channels to be cold and moist,</div>
<div>Ever before me stand, and not in vain;</div>
<div>For far more doth their image dry me up</div>
<div>Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>The rigid justice that chastises me</div>
<div>Draweth occasion from the place in which</div>
<div>I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.</div>
<div>There is Romena, where I counterfeited</div>
<div>The currency imprinted with the Baptist,</div>
<div>For which I left my body burned above.</div>
<div>But if I here could see the tristful soul</div>
<div>Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,</div>
<div>For Branda's fount I would not give the sight.</div>
<div>One is within already, if the raving</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Shades that are going round about speak truth;</div>
<div>But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?</div>
<div>If I were only still so light, that in</div>
<div>A hundred years I could advance one inch,</div>
<div>I had already started on the way,</div>
<div>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,</div>
<div>Although the circuit be eleven miles,</div>
<div>And be not less than half a mile across.</div>
<div>For them am I in such a family;</div>
<div>They did induce me into coining florins,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Which had three carats of impurity.'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'Who are the two poor wretches</div>
<div>That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,</div>
<div>Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?'</div>
<div>'I found them here,' replied he, 'when I rained</div>
<div>Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,</div>
<div>Nor do I think they will for evermore.</div>
<div>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,</div>
<div>The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;</div>
<div>From acute fever they send forth such reek.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed</div>
<div>At being, peradventure, named so darkly,</div>
<div>Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.</div>
<div>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;</div>
<div>And Master Adam smote him in the face,</div>
<div>With arm that did not seem to be less hard,</div>
<div>Saying to him: 'Although be taken from me</div>
<div>All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,</div>
<div>I have an arm unfettered for such need.'</div>
<div>Whereat he answer made: 'When thou didst go</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:</div>
<div>But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.'</div>
<div>The dropsical: 'Thou sayest true in that;</div>
<div>But thou wast not so true a witness there,</div>
<div>Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.'</div>
<div>'If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,'</div>
<div>Said Sinon; 'and for one fault I am here,</div>
<div>And thou for more than any other demon.'</div>
<div>'Remember, perjurer, about the horse,'</div>
<div>He made reply who had the swollen belly,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>'And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.'</div>
<div>'Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks</div>
<div>Thy tongue,' the Greek said, 'and the putrid water</div>
<div>That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.'</div>
<div>Then the false-coiner: 'So is gaping wide</div>
<div>Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;</div>
<div>Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me</div>
<div>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,</div>
<div>And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus</div>
<div>Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,</div>
<div>When said the Master to me: 'Just look,</div>
<div>Don't speak, or I'll get mad at you.'</div>
<div>When him I heard in anger speak to me,</div>
<div>I turned me round towards him with such shame</div>
<div>That still it eddies through my memory.</div>
<div>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,</div>
<div>Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,</div>
<div>So that he craves what is, as if it were not;</div>
<div>Such I became, not having power to speak,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>For to excuse myself I wished, and still</div>
<div>Excused myself, and did not think I did it.</div>
<div>'People have felt less bad over worse sins,'</div>
<div>The Master said, 'than you have committed;</div>
<div>So don't beat yourself up about it,</div>
<div>Remember that the Macho Man is beside you,</div>
<div>And that while we are together all is well</div>
<div>Take this knowledge and with it be secure;</div>
<div>And in the future ignore boring gossipheads.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXI.</h2>
<div>One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,</div>
<div>So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,</div>
<div>And then held out to me the medicine;</div>
<div>Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear,</div>
<div>His and his father's, used to be the cause</div>
<div>First of a sad and then a gracious boon.</div>
<div>We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,</div>
<div>Upon the bank that girds it round about,</div>
<div>Going across it without any speech.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>There it was less than night, and less than day,</div>
<div>So that my sight went little in advance;</div>
<div>But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,</div>
<div>So loud it would have made each thunder faint,</div>
<div>Which, counter to it following its way,</div>
<div>Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.</div>
<div>After the dolorous discomfiture</div>
<div>When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,</div>
<div>So terribly Orlando sounded not.</div>
<div>Short while my head turned thitherward I held</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>When many lofty towers I seemed to see,</div>
<div>Whereat I: 'Master, say, what town is this?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'You're looking far ahead</div>
<div>Into what is deep and black darkness,</div>
<div>I think you don't know what you see.</div>
<div>When we get there you will find out,</div>
<div>How wrong you are about what you see;</div>
<div>So I'll say yet again: keep moving.'</div>
<div>Then tenderly he took me by the hand,</div>
<div>And said: 'Before we go any further,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>To prep you for what is coming up,</div>
<div>I'm going to tell you right now what to expect,</div>
<div>Those things are giants yo, not towers.</div>
<div>They're huge.  Don't mess with them.'</div>
<div>As, when the fog is vanishing away,</div>
<div>Little by little doth the sight refigure</div>
<div>Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,</div>
<div>So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,</div>
<div>More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,</div>
<div>My error fled, and fear came over me;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Because as on its circular parapets</div>
<div>Montereggione crowns itself with towers,</div>
<div>E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well</div>
<div>With one half of their bodies turreted</div>
<div>The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces</div>
<div>E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.</div>
<div>And I of one already saw the face,</div>
<div>Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,</div>
<div>And down along his sides both of the arms.</div>
<div>Certainly Nature, when she left the making</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Of animals like these, did well indeed,</div>
<div>By taking such executors from Mars;</div>
<div>And if of elephants and whales she doth not</div>
<div>Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly</div>
<div>More just and more discreet will hold her for it;</div>
<div>For where the argument of intellect</div>
<div>Is added unto evil will and power,</div>
<div>No rampart can the people make against it.</div>
<div>His face appeared to me as long and large</div>
<div>As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And in proportion were the other bones;</div>
<div>So that the margin, which an apron was</div>
<div>Down from the middle, showed so much of him</div>
<div>Above it, that to reach up to his hair</div>
<div>Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;</div>
<div>For I beheld thirty great palms of him</div>
<div>Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.</div>
<div>'Raphael mai amech izabi almi,'</div>
<div>Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,</div>
<div>To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And unto him my Guide: 'Idiot soul,</div>
<div>Get away from us and blow your horn,</div>
<div>Whenever you are feeling out of sorts.</div>
<div>It's hanging around your neck, you fool</div>
<div>I know you're too stupid to remember this,</div>
<div>But if you look down you'll surely find it.'</div>
<div>Then said to me: 'This guy is The Worst;</div>
<div>His name is Nimrod and he lives up to it.</div>
<div>He barely is able to understand words.</div>
<div>Don't bother talking to him, it's pointless;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>He will probably just get mad and confused</div>
<div>That's what always happens. I would know.'</div>
<div>Therefore a longer journey did we make,</div>
<div>Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft</div>
<div>We found another far more fierce and large.</div>
<div>In binding him, who might the master be</div>
<div>I cannot say; but he had pinioned close</div>
<div>Behind the right arm, and in front the other,</div>
<div>With chains, that held him so begirt about</div>
<div>From the neck down, that on the part uncovered</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.</div>
<div>'This cocky fellow decided to pick a fight</div>
<div>And pit his own strength against Jupiter,'</div>
<div>My Leader said, 'the God, not the planet.</div>
<div>Ephialtes is his name; and he was strong.</div>
<div>But not strong enough to defeat Zeus;</div>
<div>So now he's chained here like a sucker.'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'If possible, I should wish</div>
<div>That of the measureless Briareus</div>
<div>These eyes of mine might have experience.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Whence he replied: 'You'll get to see Antaeus</div>
<div>He's close by and free to speak with us,</div>
<div>Lucky for him he never was chained up.</div>
<div>Further past him is the one you mentioned,</div>
<div>He is bound, much like Ephialtes here,</div>
<div>Except Briareus is way more fearsome.'</div>
<div>There never was an earthquake of such might</div>
<div>That it could shake a tower so violently,</div>
<div>As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.</div>
<div>Then was I more afraid of death than ever,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>For nothing more was needful than the fear,</div>
<div>If I had not beheld the manacles.</div>
<div>Then we proceeded farther in advance,</div>
<div>And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells</div>
<div>Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.</div>
<div>'Hey Antaeus buddy, long time no see!</div>
<div>How's it going down here?  Still sucky?</div>
<div>That's a shame. Look, this here is Dante.</div>
<div>I'm guiding his sorry rear through Hell,</div>
<div>And we need a little bit of help from you.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Do you think you could lend us a hand?</div>
<div>It would take us a long time of traveling</div>
<div>Whereas if you could grap and pick us up,</div>
<div>We could make some really excellent time.</div>
<div>Don't forget that you owe me Antaeus,</div>
<div>I never collected on last month's poker game;</div>
<div>And if you do this for us I'll call us square.</div>
<div>Plus there's something in it for you as well;</div>
<div>This guy is alive; when he goes back to Earth,</div>
<div>He'll totally tell everybody how cool you are.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>So said the Master; and in haste the other</div>
<div>His hands extended and took up my Guide,--</div>
<div>Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.</div>
<div>Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,</div>
<div>Said unto me: 'Come on buddy, grab my hand;'</div>
<div>Then of himself and me one bundle made.</div>
<div>As seems the Carisenda, to behold</div>
<div>Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud</div>
<div>Above it so that opposite it hangs;</div>
<div>Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Watching to see him stoop, and then it was</div>
<div>I could have wished to go some other way.</div>
<div>But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up</div>
<div>Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;</div>
<div>Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,</div>
<div>But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXII.</h2>
<div>If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,</div>
<div>As were appropriate to the dismal hole</div>
<div>Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,</div>
<div>I would press out the juice of my conception</div>
<div>More fully; but because I have them not,</div>
<div>Not without fear I bring myself to speak;</div>
<div>For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,</div>
<div>To sketch the bottom of all the universe,</div>
<div>Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,</div>
<div>Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,</div>
<div>That from the fact the word be not diverse.</div>
<div>O rabble ill-begotten above all,</div>
<div>Who're in the place to speak of which is hard,</div>
<div>'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!</div>
<div>When we were down within the darksome well,</div>
<div>Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,</div>
<div>And I was scanning still the lofty wall,</div>
<div>I heard it said to me: 'Look how thou steppest!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet</div>
<div>The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!'</div>
<div>Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me</div>
<div>And underfoot a lake, that from the frost</div>
<div>The semblance had of glass, and not of water.</div>
<div>So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current</div>
<div>In winter-time Danube in Austria,</div>
<div>Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,</div>
<div>As there was here; so that if Tambernich</div>
<div>Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak.</div>
<div>And as to croak the frog doth place himself</div>
<div>With muzzle out of water,--when is dreaming</div>
<div>Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,--</div>
<div>Livid, as far down as where shame appears,</div>
<div>Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,</div>
<div>Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.</div>
<div>Each one his countenance held downward bent;</div>
<div>From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart</div>
<div>Among them witness of itself procures.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>When round about me somewhat I had looked,</div>
<div>I downward turned me, and saw two so close,</div>
<div>The hair upon their heads together mingled.</div>
<div>'Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,'</div>
<div>I said, 'who are you;' and they bent their necks,</div>
<div>And when to me their faces they had lifted,</div>
<div>Their eyes, which first were only moist within,</div>
<div>Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed</div>
<div>The tears between, and locked them up again.</div>
<div>Clamp never bound together wood with wood</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,</div>
<div>Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.</div>
<div>And one, who had by reason of the cold</div>
<div>Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,</div>
<div>Said: 'Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?</div>
<div>If thou desire to know who these two are,</div>
<div>The valley whence Bisenzio descends</div>
<div>Belonged to them and to their father Albert.</div>
<div>They from one body came, and all Caina</div>
<div>Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;</div>
<div>Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow</div>
<div>At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;</div>
<div>Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers</div>
<div>So with his head I see no farther forward,</div>
<div>And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;</div>
<div>Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.</div>
<div>And that thou put me not to further speech,</div>
<div>Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,</div>
<div>And wait Carlino to exonerate me.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made</div>
<div>Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,</div>
<div>And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.</div>
<div>And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,</div>
<div>Where everything of weight unites together,</div>
<div>And I was shivering in the eternal shade,</div>
<div>Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,</div>
<div>I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads</div>
<div>I struck my foot hard in the face of one.</div>
<div>Weeping he growled: 'Why dost thou trample me?</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance</div>
<div>of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?'</div>
<div>And I: 'My Master, now wait here for me,</div>
<div>That I through him may issue from a doubt;</div>
<div>Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.'</div>
<div>The Leader stopped; and to that one I said</div>
<div>Who was blaspheming vehemently still:</div>
<div>'Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?'</div>
<div>'Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora</div>
<div>Smiting,' replied he, 'other people's cheeks,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?'</div>
<div>'Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,'</div>
<div>Was my response, 'if thou demandest fame,</div>
<div>That 'mid the other notes thy name I place.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'For the reverse I long;</div>
<div>Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;</div>
<div>For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.'</div>
<div>Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,</div>
<div>And said: 'It must needs be thou name thyself,</div>
<div>Or not a hair remain upon thee here.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Whence he to me: 'Though thou strip off my hair,</div>
<div>I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,</div>
<div>If on my head a thousand times thou fall.'</div>
<div>I had his hair in hand already twisted,</div>
<div>And more than one shock of it had pulled out,</div>
<div>He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,</div>
<div>When cried another: 'What doth ail thee, Bocca?</div>
<div>Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,</div>
<div>But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?'</div>
<div>'Now,' said I, 'I care not to have thee speak,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame</div>
<div>I will report of thee veracious news.'</div>
<div>'Begone,' replied he, 'and tell what thou wilt,</div>
<div>But be not silent, if thou issue hence,</div>
<div>Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;</div>
<div>He weepeth here the silver of the French;</div>

<div>Then he began: 'Thou wilt that I renew</div>
<div>The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already</div>
<div>To think of only, ere I speak of it;</div>
<div>But if my words be seed that may bear fruit</div>
<div>Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,</div>
<div>Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>I know not who thou art, nor by what mode</div>
<div>Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine</div>
<div>Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.</div>
<div>Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,</div>
<div>And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;</div>
<div>Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.</div>
<div>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,</div>
<div>Trusting in him I was made prisoner,</div>
<div>And after put to death, I need not say;</div>
<div>But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>That is to say, how cruel was my death,</div>
<div>Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.</div>
<div>A narrow perforation in the mew,</div>
<div>Which bears because of me the title of Famine,</div>
<div>And in which others still must be locked up,</div>
<div>Had shown me through its opening many moons</div>
<div>Already, when I dreamed the evil dream</div>
<div>Which of the future rent for me the veil.</div>
<div>This one appeared to me as lord and master,</div>
<div>Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.</div>
<div>With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,</div>
<div>Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi</div>
<div>He had sent out before him to the front.</div>
<div>After brief course seemed unto me forespent</div>
<div>The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes</div>
<div>It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.</div>
<div>When I before the morrow was awake,</div>
<div>Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons</div>
<div>Who with me were, and asking after bread.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,</div>
<div>Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,</div>
<div>And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?</div>
<div>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh</div>
<div>At which our food used to be brought to us,</div>
<div>And through his dream was each one apprehensive;</div>
<div>And I heard locking up the under door</div>
<div>Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word</div>
<div>I gazed into the faces of my sons.</div>
<div>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>They wept; and darling little Anselm mine</div>
<div>Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'</div>
<div>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made</div>
<div>All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,</div>
<div>Until another sun rose on the world.</div>
<div>As now a little glimmer made its way</div>
<div>Into the dolorous prison, and I saw</div>
<div>Upon four faces my own very aspect,</div>
<div>Both of my hands in agony I bit;</div>
<div>And, thinking that I did it from desire</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,</div>
<div>And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us</div>
<div>If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us</div>
<div>With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'</div>
<div>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.</div>
<div>That day we all were silent, and the next.</div>
<div>Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?</div>
<div>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo</div>
<div>Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,</div>
<div>Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,</div>
<div>I saw the three fall, one by one, between</div>
<div>The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,</div>
<div>Already blind, to groping over each,</div>
<div>And three days called them after they were dead;</div>
<div>Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.'</div>
<div>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,</div>
<div>The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,</div>
<div>Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.</div>
<div>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,</div>
<div>Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,</div>
<div>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,</div>
<div>And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno</div>
<div>That every person in thee it may drown!</div>
<div>For if Count Ugolino had the fame</div>
<div>Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,</div>
<div>Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.</div>
<div>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!</div>
<div>Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>And the other two my song doth name above!</div>
<div>We passed still farther onward, where the ice</div>
<div>Another people ruggedly enswathes,</div>
<div>Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.</div>
<div>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,</div>
<div>And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes</div>
<div>Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;</div>
<div>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,</div>
<div>And, in the manner of a crystal visor,</div>
<div>Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,</div>
<div>Because of cold all sensibility</div>
<div>Its station had abandoned in my face,</div>
<div>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;</div>
<div>Whence I: 'My Master, who sets this in motion?</div>
<div>Is not below here every vapour quenched?'</div>
<div>Whence he to me: 'Very soon you'll know.</div>
<div>You will see with your own eyes the answer,</div>
<div>And know the source of the frigid winds.'</div>
<div>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Cried out to us: 'O souls so merciless</div>
<div>That the last post is given unto you,</div>
<div>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I</div>
<div>May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart</div>
<div>A little, e'er the weeping recongeal.'</div>
<div>Whence I to him: 'If thou wouldst have me help thee</div>
<div>Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,</div>
<div>May I go to the bottom of the ice.'</div>
<div>Then he replied: 'I am Friar Alberigo;</div>
<div>He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Who here a date am getting for my fig.'</div>
<div>'O,' said I to him, 'now art thou, too, dead?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'How may my body fare</div>
<div>Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.</div>
<div>Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,</div>
<div>That oftentimes the soul descendeth here</div>
<div>Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.</div>
<div>And, that thou mayest more willingly remove</div>
<div>From off my countenance these glassy tears,</div>
<div>Know that as soon as any soul betrays</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>As I have done, his body by a demon</div>
<div>Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,</div>
<div>Until his time has wholly been revolved.</div>
<div>Itself down rushes into such a cistern;</div>
<div>And still perchance above appears the body</div>
<div>Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.</div>
<div>This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;</div>
<div>It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years</div>
<div>Have passed away since he was thus locked up.'</div>
<div>'I think,' said I to him, 'thou dost deceive me;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,</div>
<div>And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.'</div>
<div>'In moat above,' said he, 'of Malebranche,</div>
<div>There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,</div>
<div>As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,</div>
<div>When this one left a devil in his stead</div>
<div>In his own body and one near of kin,</div>
<div>Who made together with him the betrayal.</div>
<div>But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,</div>
<div>Open mine eyes;'--and open them I did not,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>And to be rude to him was courtesy.</div>
<div>Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance</div>
<div>With every virtue, full of every vice</div>
<div>Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?</div>
<div>For with the vilest spirit of Romagna</div>
<div>I found of you one such, who for his deeds</div>
<div>In soul already in Cocytus bathes,</div>
<div>And still above in body seems alive!</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXIV.</h2>
<div>'Now we are in the pit of Hell,</div>
<div>Now look at what lies at the core,'</div>
<div>My Master said, 'if you can see him.'</div>
<div>As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when</div>
<div>Our hemisphere is darkening into night,</div>
<div>Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,</div>
<div>Methought that such a building then I saw;</div>
<div>And, for the wind, I drew myself behind</div>
<div>My Guide, because there was no other shelter.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,</div>
<div>There where the shades were wholly covered up,</div>
<div>And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.</div>
<div>Some prone are lying, others stand erect,</div>
<div>This with the head, and that one with the soles;</div>
<div>Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.</div>
<div>When in advance so far we had proceeded,</div>
<div>That it my Master pleased to show to me</div>
<div>The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,</div>
<div>He from before me moved and made me stop,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Saying: 'Look upon the core of Hell,</div>
<div>And summon your most Macho of spirits!'</div>
<div>How frozen I became and powerless then,</div>
<div>Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,</div>
<div>Because all language would be insufficient.</div>
<div>I did not die, and I alive remained not;</div>
<div>Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,</div>
<div>What I became, being of both deprived.</div>
<div>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous</div>
<div>From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>And better with a giant I compare</div>
<div>Than do the giants with those arms of his;</div>
<div>Consider now how great must be that whole,</div>
<div>Which unto such a part conforms itself.</div>
<div>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,</div>
<div>And lifted up his brow against his Maker,</div>
<div>Well may proceed from him all tribulation.</div>
<div>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,</div>
<div>When I beheld three faces on his head!</div>
<div>The one in front, and that vermilion was;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Two were the others, that were joined with this</div>
<div>Above the middle part of either shoulder,</div>
<div>And they were joined together at the crest;</div>
<div>And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;</div>
<div>The left was such to look upon as those</div>
<div>Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.</div>
<div>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,</div>
<div>Such as befitting were so great a bird;</div>
<div>Sails of the sea I never saw so large.</div>
<div>No feathers had they, but as of a bat</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Their fashion was; and he was waving them,</div>
<div>So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</div>
<div>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.</div>
<div>With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins</div>
<div>Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.</div>
<div>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching</div>
<div>A sinner, in the manner of a brake,</div>
<div>So that he three of them tormented thus.</div>
<div>To him in front the biting was as naught</div>
<div>Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.</div>
<div>'That soul up there which has the greatest pain,'</div>
<div>The Master said, 'is Judas Iscariot;</div>
<div>You cna probably figure out why.</div>
<div>If you look a little lower in the mouth,</div>
<div>You can see a fellow hanging; that's Brutus.</div>
<div>The way he writhes shows he must be in pain.</div>
<div>The third one there is Cassius. See him?</div>
<div>But the night is almost over now, yes?</div>
<div>We need to press on. You've seen it all.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,</div>
<div>And he the vantage seized of time and place,</div>
<div>And when the wings were opened wide apart,</div>
<div>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;</div>
<div>From fell to fell descended downward then</div>
<div>Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.</div>
<div>When we were come to where the thigh revolves</div>
<div>Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,</div>
<div>The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,</div>
<div>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,</div>
<div>So that to Hell I thought we were returning.</div>
<div>'Hold on tight and make sure not to slip,'</div>
<div>The Master said, panting as one fatigued,</div>
<div>'We are leaving the center of evil behind.'</div>
<div>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,</div>
<div>And down upon the margin seated me;</div>
<div>Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.</div>
<div>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see</div>
<div>Lucifer in the same way I had left him;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>And I beheld him upward hold his legs.</div>
<div>And if I then became disquieted,</div>
<div>Let stolid people think who do not see</div>
<div>What the point is beyond which I had passed.</div>
<div>'Rise up,' the Master said, 'on your feet;</div>
<div>The way is long, and the road is hard,</div>
<div>And the sun is now rising in the sky.'</div>
<div>It was not any palace corridor</div>
<div>There where we were, but dungeon natural,</div>
<div>With floor uneven and unease of light.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>'Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,</div>
<div>My Master,' said I when I had arisen,</div>
<div>'To draw me from an error speak a little;</div>
<div>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed</div>
<div>Thus upside down? and how in such short time</div>
<div>From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'A wizard did it.'</div>
<div>A place there is below, from Beelzebub</div>
<div>As far receding as the tomb extends,</div>
<div>Which not by sight is known, but by the sound</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth</div>
<div>Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed</div>
<div>With course that winds about and slightly falls.</div>
<div>The Guide and I into that hidden road</div>
<div>Now entered, to return to the bright world;</div>
<div>And without care of having any rest</div>
<div>We mounted up, he first and I the second,</div>
<div>Till I beheld through a round aperture</div>
<div>Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;</div>
<div>Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</div>
