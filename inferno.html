<h1>I N F E R N O</h1>
<h3>By Dante Alighieri</h3>
<h2>CANTO I.</h2>
<div>In middle of the journey of our days</div>
<div>I found that I was in a darksome wood--</div>
<div>The right road lost and vanished in the maze.</div>
<div>Ah me! how hard to make it understood</div>
<div>How rough that wood was, wild, and terrible:</div>
<div>By the mere thought my terror is renewed.</div>
<div>More bitter scarce were death. But ere I tell</div>
<div>At large of good which there by me was found,</div>
<div>I will relate what other things befell.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Scarce know I how I entered on that ground,</div>
<div>So deeply, at the moment when I passed</div>
<div>From the right way, was I in slumber drowned.</div>
<div>But when beneath a hill arrived at last,</div>
<div>Which for the boundary of the valley stood,</div>
<div>That with such terror had my heart harassed,</div>
<div>I upwards looked and saw its shoulders glowed,</div>
<div>Radiant already with that planet's light</div>
<div>Which guideth surely upon every road.</div>
<div>A little then was quieted by the sight</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>The fear which deep within my heart had lain</div>
<div>Through all my sore experience of the night.</div>
<div>And as the man, who, breathing short in pain,</div>
<div>Hath 'scaped the sea and struggled to the shore,</div>
<div>Turns back to gaze upon the perilous main;</div>
<div>Even so my soul which fear still forward bore</div>
<div>Turned to review the pass whence I egressed,</div>
<div>And which none, living, ever left before.</div>
<div>My wearied frame refreshed with scanty rest,</div>
<div>I to ascend the lonely hill essayed;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>The lower foot still that on which I pressed.</div>
<div>And lo! ere I had well beginning made,</div>
<div>A nimble leopard, light upon her feet,</div>
<div>And in a skin all spotted o'er arrayed:</div>
<div>Nor ceased she e'er me full in the face to meet,</div>
<div>And to me in my path such hindrance threw</div>
<div>That many a time I wheeled me to retreat.</div>
<div>It was the hour of dawn; with retinue</div>
<div>Of stars that were with him when Love Divine</div>
<div>In the beginning into motion drew</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Those beauteous things, the sun began to shine;</div>
<div>And I took heart to be of better cheer</div>
<div>Touching the creature with the gaudy skin,</div>
<div>Seeing 'twas morn, and spring-tide of the year;</div>
<div>Yet not so much but that when into sight</div>
<div>A lion came, I was disturbed with fear.</div>
<div>Towards me he seemed advancing in his might,</div>
<div>Rabid with hunger and with head high thrown:</div>
<div>The very air was tremulous with fright.</div>
<div>A she-wolf, too, beheld I further on;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>All kinds of lust seemed in her leanness pent:</div>
<div>Through her, ere now, much folk have misery known.</div>
<div>By her oppressed, and altogether spent</div>
<div>By the terror breathing from her aspect fell,</div>
<div>I lost all hope of making the ascent.</div>
<div>And as the man who joys while thriving well,</div>
<div>When comes the time to lose what he has won</div>
<div>In all his thoughts weeps inconsolable,</div>
<div>So mourned I through the brute which rest knows none:</div>
<div>She barred my way again and yet again,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And thrust me back where silent is the sun.</div>
<div>And as I downward rushed to reach the plain,</div>
<div>Before mine eyes appeared there one aghast,</div>
<div>And dumb like those that silence long maintain.</div>
<div>When I beheld him in the desert vast,</div>
<div>'Whate'er thou art, or ghost or man,' I cried,</div>
<div>'I pray thee show such pity as thou hast.'</div>
<div>'No man, though once I was; on either side</div>
<div>Lombard my parents were, and both of them</div>
<div>For native place had Mantua,' he replied.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>'Though late, sub Julio, to the world I came,</div>
<div>And lived at Rome in good Augustus' day,</div>
<div>While yet false gods and lying were supreme.</div>
<div>Poet I was, renowning in my lay</div>
<div>Anchises' righteous son, who fled from Troy</div>
<div>What time proud Ilion was to flames a prey.</div>
<div>But thou, why going back to such annoy?</div>
<div>The hill delectable why fear to mount,</div>
<div>The origin and ground of every joy?'</div>
<div>'And thou in sooth art Virgil, and the fount</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Whence in a stream so full doth language flow?'</div>
<div>Abashed, I answered him with humble front.</div>
<div>'Of other poets light and honour thou!</div>
<div>Let the long study and great zeal I've shown</div>
<div>In searching well thy book, avail me now!</div>
<div>My master thou, and author thou, alone!</div>
<div>From thee alone I, borrowing, could attain</div>
<div>The style consummate which has made me known.</div>
<div>Behold the beast which makes me turn again:</div>
<div>Deliver me from her, illustrious Sage;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Because of her I tremble, pulse and vein.'</div>
<div>'Thou must attempt another pilgrimage,'</div>
<div>Observing that I wept, he made reply,</div>
<div>'If from this waste thyself thou 'dst disengage.</div>
<div>Because the beast thou art afflicted by</div>
<div>Will suffer none along her way to pass,</div>
<div>But, hindering them, harasses till they die.</div>
<div>So vile a nature and corrupt she has,</div>
<div>Her raging lust is still insatiate,</div>
<div>And food but makes it fiercer than it was.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Many a creature hath she ta'en for mate,</div>
<div>And more she'll wed until the hound comes forth</div>
<div>To slay her and afflict with torment great.</div>
<div>He will not batten upon pelf or earth;</div>
<div>But he shall feed on valour, love, and lore;</div>
<div>Feltro and Feltro 'tween shall be his birth.</div>
<div>He will save humbled Italy, and restore,</div>
<div>For which of old virgin Camilla died;</div>
<div>Turnus, Euryalus, Nisus, died of yore.</div>
<div>Her through all cities chasing far and wide,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>He at the last to Hell will thrust her down,</div>
<div>Whence envy first unloosed her. I decide</div>
<div>Therefore and judge that thou hadst best come on</div>
<div>With me for guide; and hence I'll lead thee where</div>
<div>A place eternal shall to thee be shown.</div>
<div>There shalt thou hear the howlings of despair</div>
<div>In which the ancient spirits make lament,</div>
<div>All of them fain the second death to share.</div>
<div>Next shalt thou them behold who are content,</div>
<div>Because they hope some time, though now in fire,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>To join the blessed they will win consent.</div>
<div>And if to these thou later wouldst aspire,</div>
<div>A soul shall guide thee, worthier far than I;</div>
<div>When I depart thee will I leave with her.</div>
<div>Because the Emperor who reigns on high</div>
<div>Wills not, since 'gainst His laws I did rebel,</div>
<div>That to His city I bring any nigh.</div>
<div>O'er all the world He rules, there reigns as well;</div>
<div>There is His city and exalted seat:</div>
<div>O happy whom He chooses there to dwell!'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>And I to him: 'Poet, I thee entreat,</div>
<div>Even by that God who was to thee unknown,</div>
<div>That I may 'scape this present ill, nor meet</div>
<div>With worse, conduct me whither thou hast shown,</div>
<div>That I may see Saint Peter's gate, and those</div>
<div>Whom thou reportest in such misery thrown.'</div>
<div>He moved away; behind him held I close.</div>
<h2>CANTO II.</h2>
<div>It was the close of day; the twilight brown</div>
<div>All living things on earth was setting free</div>
<div>From toil, while I preparing was alone</div>
<div>To face the battle which awaited me,</div>
<div>As well of ruth as of the perilous quest,</div>
<div>Now to be limned by faultless memory.</div>
<div>Help, lofty genius! Muses, manifest</div>
<div>Goodwill to me! Recording what befell,</div>
<div>Do thou, O mind, now show thee at thy best!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>I thus began: 'Poet, and Guide as well,</div>
<div>Ere trusting me on this adventure wide,</div>
<div>Judge if my strength of it be capable.</div>
<div>Thou say'st that Silvius' father, ere he died,</div>
<div>Still mortal to the world immortal went,</div>
<div>There in the body some time to abide.</div>
<div>Yet that the Foe of evil was content</div>
<div>That he should come, seeing what high effect,</div>
<div>And who and what should from him claim descent,</div>
<div>No room for doubt can thoughtful man detect:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>For he of noble Rome, and of her sway</div>
<div>Imperial, in high Heaven grew sire elect.</div>
<div>And both of these, the very truth to say,</div>
<div>Were founded for the holy seat, whereon</div>
<div>The Greater Peter's follower sits to-day.</div>
<div>Upon this journey, praised by thee, were known</div>
<div>And heard things by him, to the which he owed</div>
<div>His triumph, whence derives the Papal gown.</div>
<div>That path the Chosen Vessel later trod</div>
<div>So of the faith assurance to receive,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Which is beginning of salvation's road.</div>
<div>But why should I go? Who will sanction give?</div>
<div>For I am no Aeneas and no Paul;</div>
<div>Me worthy of it no one can believe,</div>
<div>Nor I myself. Hence venturing at thy call,</div>
<div>I dread the journey may prove rash. But vain</div>
<div>For me to reason; wise, thou know'st it all.'</div>
<div>Like one no more for what he wished for fain,</div>
<div>Whose purpose shares mutation with his thought</div>
<div>Till from the thing begun he turns again;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>On that dim slope so grew I all distraught,</div>
<div>Because, by brooding on it, the design</div>
<div>I shrank from, which before I warmly sought.</div>
<div>'If well I understand these words of thine,'</div>
<div>The shade of him magnanimous made reply,</div>
<div>'Thy soul 'neath cowardice hath sunk supine,</div>
<div>Which a man often is so burdened by,</div>
<div>It makes him falter from a noble aim,</div>
<div>As beasts at objects ill-distinguished shy.</div>
<div>To loose thee from this terror, why I came,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>And what the speech I heard, I will relate,</div>
<div>When first of all I pitied thee. A dame</div>
<div>Hailed me where I 'mongst those in dubious state</div>
<div>Had my abode: so blest was she and fair,</div>
<div>Her to command me I petitioned straight.</div>
<div>Her eyes were shining brighter than the star;</div>
<div>And she began to say in accents sweet</div>
<div>And tuneable as angel's voices are:</div>
<div>"O Mantuan Shade, in courtesy complete,</div>
<div>Whose fame survives on earth, nor less shall grow</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Through all the ages, while the world hath seat;</div>
<div>A friend of mine, with fortune for his foe,</div>
<div>Has met with hindrance on his desert way,</div>
<div>And, terror-smitten, can no further go,</div>
<div>But turns; and that he is too far astray,</div>
<div>And that I rose too late for help, I dread,</div>
<div>From what in Heaven concerning him they say.</div>
<div>Go, with thy speech persuasive him bestead,</div>
<div>And with all needful help his guardian prove,</div>
<div>That touching him I may be comforted.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Know, it is Beatrice seeks thee thus to move.</div>
<div>Thence come I where I to return am fain:</div>
<div>My coming and my plea are ruled by love.</div>
<div>When I shall stand before my Lord again,</div>
<div>Often to Him I will renew thy praise."</div>
<div>And here she ceased, nor did I dumb remain:</div>
<div>"O virtuous Lady, thou alone the race</div>
<div>Of man exaltest 'bove all else that dwell</div>
<div>Beneath the heaven which wheels in narrowest space.</div>
<div>To do thy bidding pleases me so well,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Though 'twere already done 'twere all too slow;</div>
<div>Thy wish at greater length no need to tell.</div>
<div>But say, what tempted thee to come thus low,</div>
<div>Even to this centre, from the region vast,</div>
<div>Whither again thou art on fire to go?"</div>
<div>"This much to learn since a desire thou hast,"</div>
<div>She answered, "briefly thee I'll satisfy,</div>
<div>How, coming here, I through no terrors passed.</div>
<div>We are, of right, such things alarmed by,</div>
<div>As have the power to hurt us; all beside</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Are harmless, and not fearful. Wherefore I--</div>
<div>Thus formed by God, His bounty is so wide--</div>
<div>Am left untouched by all your miseries,</div>
<div>And through this burning unmolested glide.</div>
<div>A noble lady is in Heaven, who sighs</div>
<div>O'er the obstruction where I'd have thee go,</div>
<div>And breaks the rigid edict of the skies.</div>
<div>Calling on Lucia, thus she made her know</div>
<div>What she desired: 'Thy vassal now hath need</div>
<div>Of help from thee; do thou then helpful show.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Lucia, who hates all cruelty, in speed</div>
<div>Rose, and approaching where I sat at rest,</div>
<div>To venerable Rachel giving heed,</div>
<div>Me: 'Beatrice, true praise of God,' addressed;</div>
<div>'Why not help him who had such love for thee,</div>
<div>And from the vulgar throng to win thee pressed?</div>
<div>Dost thou not hear him weeping pitiably,</div>
<div>Nor mark the death now threatening him upon</div>
<div>A flood than which less awful is the sea?'</div>
<div>Never on earth did any ever run,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Allured by profit or impelled by fear,</div>
<div>Swifter than I, when speaking she had done,</div>
<div>From sitting 'mong the blest descended here,</div>
<div>My trust upon thy comely rhetoric cast,</div>
<div>Which honours thee and those who lend it ear."</div>
<div>When of these words she spoken had the last,</div>
<div>She turned aside bright eyes which tears did fill,</div>
<div>And I by this was urged to greater haste.</div>
<div>And so it was I joined thee by her will,</div>
<div>And from that raging beast delivered thee,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Which barred the near way up the beauteous hill.</div>
<div>What ails thee then? Why thus a laggard be?</div>
<div>Why cherish in thy heart a craven fear?</div>
<div>Where is thy franchise, where thy bravery,</div>
<div>When three such blessed ladies have a care</div>
<div>For thee in Heaven's court, and these words of mine</div>
<div>Thee for such wealth of blessedness prepare?'</div>
<div>As flowers, by chills nocturnal made to pine</div>
<div>And shut themselves, when touched by morning bright</div>
<div>Upon their stems arise, full-blown and fine;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>So of my faltering courage changed the plight,</div>
<div>And such good cheer ran through my heart, it spurred</div>
<div>Me to declare, like free-born generous wight:</div>
<div>'O pitiful, who for my succour stirred!</div>
<div>And thou how full of courtesy to run,</div>
<div>Alert in service, hearkening her true word!</div>
<div>Thou with thine eloquence my heart hast won</div>
<div>To keen desire to go, and the intent</div>
<div>Which first I held I now no longer shun.</div>
<div>Therefore proceed; my will with thine is blent:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Thou art my Guide, Lord, Master; thou alone!'</div>
<div>Thus I; and with him, as he forward went,</div>
<div>The steep and rugged road I entered on.</div>
<h2>CANTO III.</h2>
<div>Through me to the city dolorous lies the way,</div>
<div>Who pass through me shall pains eternal prove,</div>
<div>Through me are reached the people lost for aye.</div>
<div>'Twas Justice did my Glorious Maker move;</div>
<div>I was created by the Power Divine,</div>
<div>The Highest Wisdom, and the Primal Love.</div>
<div>No thing's creation earlier was than mine,</div>
<div>If not eternal; I for aye endure:</div>
<div>Ye who make entrance, every hope resign!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>These words beheld I writ in hue obscure</div>
<div>On summit of a gateway; wherefore I:</div>
<div>'Hard is their meaning, Master.' Like one sure</div>
<div>Beforehand of my thought, he made reply:</div>
<div>'Here it behoves to leave all fears behind;</div>
<div>All cowardice behoveth here to die.</div>
<div>For now the place I told thee of we find,</div>
<div>Where thou the miserable folk shouldst see</div>
<div>Who the true good of reason have resigned.'</div>
<div>Then, with a glance of glad serenity,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>He took my hand in his, which made me bold,</div>
<div>And brought me in where secret things there be.</div>
<div>There sighs and plaints and wailings uncontrolled</div>
<div>The dim and starless air resounded through;</div>
<div>Nor at the first could I from tears withhold.</div>
<div>The various languages and words of woe,</div>
<div>The uncouth accents, mixed with angry cries</div>
<div>And smiting palms and voices loud and low,</div>
<div>Composed a tumult which doth circling rise</div>
<div>For ever in that air obscured for aye;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>As when the sand upon the whirlwind flies.</div>
<div>And, horror-stricken, I began to say:</div>
<div>'Master, what sound can this be that I hear,</div>
<div>And who the folk thus whelmed in misery?'</div>
<div>And he replied: 'In this condition drear</div>
<div>Are held the souls of that inglorious crew</div>
<div>Who lived unhonoured, but from guilt kept clear.</div>
<div>Mingled they are with caitiff angels, who,</div>
<div>Though from avowed rebellion they refrained,</div>
<div>Disloyal to God, did selfish ends pursue.</div>
<div>Heaven hurled them forth, lest they her beauty stained;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">41</aside>Received they are not by the nether hell,</div>
<div>Else triumph thence were by the guilty gained.'</div>
<div>And I: 'What bear they, Master, to compel</div>
<div>Their lamentations in such grievous tone?'</div>
<div>He answered: 'In few words I will thee tell.</div>
<div>No hope of death is to the wretches known;</div>
<div>So dim the life and abject where they sigh</div>
<div>They count all sufferings easier than their own.</div>
<div>Of them the world endures no memory;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Mercy and justice them alike disdain.</div>
<div>Speak we not of them: glance, and pass them by.'</div>
<div>I saw a banner when I looked again,</div>
<div>Which, always whirling round, advanced in haste</div>
<div>As if despising steadfast to remain.</div>
<div>And after it so many people chased</div>
<div>In long procession, I should not have said</div>
<div>That death had ever wrought such countless waste.</div>
<div>Some first I recognised, and then the shade</div>
<div>I saw and knew of him, the search to close,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Whose dastard soul the great refusal made.</div>
<div>Straightway I knew and was assured that those</div>
<div>Were of the tribe of caitiffs, even the race</div>
<div>Despised of God and hated of His foes.</div>
<div>The wretches, who when living showed no trace</div>
<div>Of life, went naked, and were fiercely stung</div>
<div>By wasps and hornets swarming in that place.</div>
<div>Blood drawn by these out of their faces sprung</div>
<div>And, mingled with their tears, was at their feet</div>
<div>Sucked up by loathsome worms it fell among.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Casting mine eyes beyond, of these replete,</div>
<div>People I saw beside an ample stream,</div>
<div>Whereon I said: 'O Master, I entreat,</div>
<div>Tell who these are, and by what law they seem</div>
<div>Impatient till across the river gone;</div>
<div>As I distinguish by this feeble gleam.'</div>
<div>And he: 'These things shall unto thee be known</div>
<div>What time our footsteps shall at rest be found</div>
<div>Upon the woful shores of Acheron.'</div>
<div>Then with ashamed eyes cast on the ground,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Fearing my words were irksome in his ear,</div>
<div>Until we reached the stream I made no sound.</div>
<div>And toward us, lo, within a bark drew near</div>
<div>A veteran who with ancient hair was white,</div>
<div>Shouting: 'Ye souls depraved, be filled with fear.</div>
<div>Hope never more of Heaven to win the sight;</div>
<div>I come to take you to the other strand,</div>
<div>To frost and fire and everlasting night.</div>
<div>And thou, O living soul, who there dost stand,</div>
<div>From 'mong the dead withdraw thee.' Then, aware</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>That not at all I stirred at his command,</div>
<div>'By other ways, from other ports thou'lt fare;</div>
<div>But they will lead thee to another shore,</div>
<div>And 'tis a skiff more buoyant must thee bear.'</div>
<div>And then my leader: 'Charon, be not sore,</div>
<div>For thus it has been willed where power ne'er came</div>
<div>Short of the will; thou therefore ask no more.'</div>
<div>And hereupon his shaggy cheeks grew tame</div>
<div>Who is the pilot of the livid pool,</div>
<div>And round about whose eyes glowed wheels of flame.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>But all the shades, naked and spent with dool,</div>
<div>Stood chattering with their teeth, and changing hue</div>
<div>Soon as they heard the words unmerciful.</div>
<div>God they blasphemed, and families whence they grew;</div>
<div>Mankind, the time, place, seed in which began</div>
<div>Their lives, and seed whence they were born. Then drew</div>
<div>They crowding all together, as they ran,</div>
<div>Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore</div>
<div>Predestinate for every godless man.</div>
<div>The demon Charon, with eyes evermore</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Aglow, makes signals, gathering them all;</div>
<div>And whoso lingers smiteth with his oar.</div>
<div>And as the faded leaves of autumn fall</div>
<div>One after the other, till at last the bough</div>
<div>Sees on the ground spread all its coronal;</div>
<div>With Adam's evil seed so haps it now:</div>
<div>At signs each falls in turn from off the coast,</div>
<div>As fowls into the ambush fluttering go.</div>
<div>The gloomy waters thus by them are crossed,</div>
<div>And ere upon the further side they land,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>On this, anew, is gathering a host.</div>
<div>'Son,' said the courteous Master, 'understand,</div>
<div>All such as in the wrath of God expire,</div>
<div>From every country muster on this strand.</div>
<div>To cross the river they are all on fire;</div>
<div>Their wills by Heavenly justice goaded on</div>
<div>Until their terror merges in desire.</div>
<div>This way no righteous soul has ever gone;</div>
<div>Wherefore of thee if Charon should complain,</div>
<div>Now art thou sure what by his words is shown.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>When he had uttered this the dismal plain</div>
<div>Trembled so violently, my terror past</div>
<div>Recalling now, I'm bathed in sweat again.</div>
<div>Out of the tearful ground there moaned a blast</div>
<div>Whence lightning flashed forth red and terrible,</div>
<div>Which vanquished all my senses; and, as cast</div>
<div>In sudden slumber, to the ground I fell.</div>
<h2>CANTO IV.</h2>
<div>Resounding thunder broke the slumber deep</div>
<div>That drowsed my senses, and myself I shook</div>
<div>Like one by force awakened out of sleep.</div>
<div>Then rising up I cast a steady look,</div>
<div>With eyes refreshed, on all that lay around,</div>
<div>And cognisance of where I found me took.</div>
<div>In sooth, me on the valley's brink I found</div>
<div>Of the dolorous abyss, where infinite</div>
<div>Despairing cries converge with thundering sound.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Cloudy it was, and deep, and dark as night;</div>
<div>So dark that, peering eagerly to find</div>
<div>What its depths held, no object met my sight.</div>
<div>'Descend we now into this region blind,'</div>
<div>Began the Poet with a face all pale;</div>
<div>'I will go first, and do thou come behind.'</div>
<div>Marking the wanness on his cheek prevail,</div>
<div>I asked, 'How can I, seeing thou hast dread,</div>
<div>My wonted comforter when doubts assail?'</div>
<div>'The anguish of the people,' then he said,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>'Who are below, has painted on my face</div>
<div>Pity, by thee for fear interpreted.</div>
<div>Come! The long journey bids us move apace.'</div>
<div>Then entered he and made me enter too</div>
<div>The topmost circle girding the abyss.</div>
<div>Therein, as far as I by listening knew,</div>
<div>There was no lamentation save of sighs,</div>
<div>Whence throbbed the air eternal through and through.</div>
<div>This, sorrow without suffering made arise</div>
<div>From infants and from women and from men,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Gathered in great and many companies.</div>
<div>And the good Master: 'Wouldst thou nothing then</div>
<div>Of who those spirits are have me relate?</div>
<div>Yet know, ere passing further, although when</div>
<div>On earth they sinned not, worth however great</div>
<div>Availed them not, they being unbaptized--</div>
<div>Part of the faith thou holdest. If their fate</div>
<div>Was to be born ere man was Christianised,</div>
<div>God, as behoved, they never could adore:</div>
<div>And I myself am with this folk comprised.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>For such defects--our guilt is nothing more--</div>
<div>We are thus lost, suffering from this alone</div>
<div>That, hopeless, we our want of bliss deplore.'</div>
<div>Greatly I sorrowed when he made this known,</div>
<div>Because I knew that some who did excel</div>
<div>In worthiness were to that limbo gone.</div>
<div>'Tell me, O Sir,' I prayed him, 'Master, tell,'</div>
<div>--That I of the belief might surety win,</div>
<div>Victorious every error to dispel--</div>
<div>'Did ever any hence to bliss attain</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>By merit of another or his own?'</div>
<div>And he, to whom my hidden drift was plain:</div>
<div>'I to this place but lately had come down,</div>
<div>When I beheld one hither make descent;</div>
<div>A Potentate who wore a victor's crown.</div>
<div>The shade of our first sire forth with him went,</div>
<div>And his son Abel's, Noah's forth he drew,</div>
<div>Moses' who gave the laws, the obedient</div>
<div>Patriarch Abram's, and King David's too;</div>
<div>And, with his sire and children, Israel,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And Rachel, winning whom such toils he knew;</div>
<div>And many more, in blessedness to dwell.</div>
<div>And I would have thee know, earlier than these</div>
<div>No human soul was ever saved from Hell.'</div>
<div>While thus he spake our progress did not cease,</div>
<div>But we continued through the wood to stray;</div>
<div>The wood, I mean, with crowded ghosts for trees.</div>
<div>Ere from the summit far upon our way</div>
<div>We yet had gone, I saw a flame which glowed,</div>
<div>Holding a hemisphere of dark at bay.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>'Twas still a little further on our road,</div>
<div>Yet not so far but that in part I guessed</div>
<div>That honourable people there abode.</div>
<div>'Of art and science Ornament confessed!</div>
<div>Who are these honoured in such high degree,</div>
<div>And in their lot distinguished from the rest?'</div>
<div>He said: 'For them their glorious memory,</div>
<div>Still in thy world the subject of renown,</div>
<div>Wins grace by Heaven distinguished thus to be.'</div>
<div>Meanwhile I heard a voice: 'Be honour shown</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>To the illustrious poet, for his shade</div>
<div>Is now returning which a while was gone.'</div>
<div>When the voice paused nor further utterance made,</div>
<div>Four mighty shades drew near with one accord,</div>
<div>In aspect neither sorrowful nor glad.</div>
<div>'Consider that one, armed with a sword,'</div>
<div>Began my worthy Master in my ear,</div>
<div>'Before the three advancing like their lord;</div>
<div>For he is Homer, poet with no peer:</div>
<div>Horace the satirist is next in line,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Ovid comes third, and Lucan in the rear.</div>
<div>And 'tis because their claim agrees with mine</div>
<div>Upon the name they with one voice did cry,</div>
<div>They to their honour in my praise combine.'</div>
<div>Thus I beheld their goodly company--</div>
<div>The lords of song in that exalted style</div>
<div>Which o'er all others, eagle-like, soars high.</div>
<div>Having conferred among themselves a while</div>
<div>They turned toward me and salutation made,</div>
<div>And, this beholding, did my Master smile.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And honour higher still to me was paid,</div>
<div>For of their company they made me one;</div>
<div>So I the sixth part 'mong such genius played.</div>
<div>Thus journeyed we to where the brightness shone,</div>
<div>Holding discourse which now 'tis well to hide,</div>
<div>As, where I was, to hold it was well done.</div>
<div>At length we reached a noble castle's side</div>
<div>Which lofty sevenfold walls encompassed round,</div>
<div>And it was moated by a sparkling tide.</div>
<div>This we traversed as if it were dry ground;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>I through seven gates did with those sages go;</div>
<div>Then in a verdant mead people we found</div>
<div>Whose glances were deliberate and slow.</div>
<div>Authority was stamped on every face;</div>
<div>Seldom they spake, in tuneful voices low.</div>
<div>We drew apart to a high open space</div>
<div>Upon one side which, luminously serene,</div>
<div>Did of them all a perfect view embrace.</div>
<div>Thence, opposite, on the enamel green</div>
<div>Were shown me mighty spirits; with delight</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>I still am stirred them only to have seen.</div>
<div>With many more, Electra was in sight;</div>
<div>'Mong them I Hector and Aeneas spied,</div>
<div>Caesar in arms, his eyes, like falcon's, bright.</div>
<div>And, opposite, Camilla I descried;</div>
<div>Penthesilea too; the Latian King</div>
<div>Sat with his child Lavinia by his side.</div>
<div>Brutus I saw, who Tarquin forth did fling;</div>
<div>Cornelia, Marcia, Julia, and Lucrece.</div>
<div>Saladin sat alone. Considering</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>What lay beyond with somewhat lifted eyes,</div>
<div>The Master I beheld of those that know,</div>
<div>'Mong such as in philosophy were wise.</div>
<div>All gazed on him as if toward him to show</div>
<div>Becoming honour; Plato in advance</div>
<div>With Socrates: the others stood below.</div>
<div>Democritus who set the world on chance;</div>
<div>Thales, Diogenes, Empedocles,</div>
<div>Zeno, and Anaxagoras met my glance;</div>
<div>Heraclitus, and Dioscorides,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Wise judge of nature. Tully, Orpheus, were</div>
<div>With ethic Seneca and Linus. These,</div>
<div>And Ptolemy, too, and Euclid, geometer,</div>
<div>Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicen,</div>
<div>Averroes, the same who did prepare</div>
<div>The Comment, saw I; nor can tell again</div>
<div>The names of all I saw; the subject wide</div>
<div>So urgent is, time often fails me. Then</div>
<div>Into two bands the six of us divide;</div>
<div>Me by another way my Leader wise</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>Doth from the calm to air which trembles, guide.</div>
<div>I reach a part which all benighted lies.</div>
<h2>CANTO V.</h2>
<div>From the First Circle thus I downward went</div>
<div>Into the Second, which girds narrower space,</div>
<div>But greater woe compelling loud lament.</div>
<div>Minos waits awful there and snarls, the case</div>
<div>Examining of all who enter in;</div>
<div>And, as he girds him, dooms them to their place.</div>
<div>I say, each ill-starred spirit must begin</div>
<div>On reaching him its guilt in full to tell;</div>
<div>And he, omniscient as concerning sin,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Sees to what circle it belongs in Hell;</div>
<div>Then round him is his tail as often curled</div>
<div>As he would have it stages deep to dwell.</div>
<div>And evermore before him stand a world</div>
<div>Of shades; and all in turn to judgment come,</div>
<div>Confess and hear, and then are downward hurled.</div>
<div>'O thou who comest to the very home</div>
<div>Of woe,' when he beheld me Minos cried,</div>
<div>Ceasing a while from utterance of doom,</div>
<div>'Enter not rashly nor in all confide;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>By ease of entering be not led astray.'</div>
<div>'Why also growling?' answered him my Guide;</div>
<div>'Seek not his course predestinate to stay;</div>
<div>For thus 'tis willed where nothing ever fails</div>
<div>Of what is willed. No further speech essay.'</div>
<div>And now by me are agonising wails</div>
<div>Distinguished plain; now am I come outright</div>
<div>Where grievous lamentation me assails.</div>
<div>Now had I reached a place devoid of light,</div>
<div>Raging as in a tempest howls the sea</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>When with it winds, blown thwart each other, fight.</div>
<div>The infernal storm is raging ceaselessly,</div>
<div>Sweeping the shades along with it, and them</div>
<div>It smites and whirls, nor lets them ever be.</div>
<div>Arrived at the precipitous extreme,</div>
<div>In shrieks and lamentations they complain,</div>
<div>And even the Power Divine itself blaspheme.</div>
<div>I understood that to this mode of pain</div>
<div>Are doomed the sinners of the carnal kind,</div>
<div>Who o'er their reason let their impulse reign.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>As starlings in the winter-time combined</div>
<div>Float on the wing in crowded phalanx wide,</div>
<div>So these bad spirits, driven by that wind,</div>
<div>Float up and down and veer from side to side;</div>
<div>Nor for their comfort any hope they spy</div>
<div>Of rest, or even of suffering mollified.</div>
<div>And as the cranes in long-drawn company</div>
<div>Pursue their flight while uttering their song,</div>
<div>So I beheld approach with wailing cry</div>
<div>Shades lifted onward by that whirlwind strong.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>'Master, what folk are these,' I therefore said,</div>
<div>'Who by the murky air are whipped along?'</div>
<div>'She, first of them,' his answer thus was made,</div>
<div>'Of whom thou wouldst a wider knowledge win,</div>
<div>O'er many tongues and peoples, empire swayed.</div>
<div>So ruined was she by licentious sin</div>
<div>That she decreed lust should be uncontrolled,</div>
<div>To ease the shame that she herself was in.</div>
<div>She is Semiramis, of whom 'tis told</div>
<div>She followed Ninus, and his wife had been.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Hers were the realms now by the Sultan ruled.</div>
<div>The next is she who, amorous and self-slain,</div>
<div>Unto Sichaeus' dust did faithless show:</div>
<div>Then lustful Cleopatra.' Next was seen</div>
<div>Helen, for whom so many years in woe</div>
<div>Ran out; and I the great Achilles knew,</div>
<div>Who at the last encountered love for foe.</div>
<div>Paris I saw and Tristram. In review</div>
<div>A thousand shades and more, he one by one</div>
<div>Pointed and named, whom love from life withdrew.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And after I had heard my Teacher run</div>
<div>O'er many a dame of yore and many a knight,</div>
<div>I, lost in pity, was wellnigh undone.</div>
<div>Then I: 'O Poet, if I only might</div>
<div>Speak with the two that as companions hie,</div>
<div>And on the wind appear to be so light!'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'When they shall come more nigh</div>
<div>Them shalt thou mark, and by the love shalt pray</div>
<div>Which leads them onward, and they will comply.'</div>
<div>Soon as the wind bends them to where we stay</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>I lift my voice: 'O wearied souls and worn!</div>
<div>Come speak with us if none the boon gainsay.'</div>
<div>Then even as doves, urged by desire, return</div>
<div>On outspread wings and firm to their sweet nest</div>
<div>As through the air by mere volition borne,</div>
<div>From Dido's band those spirits issuing pressed</div>
<div>Towards where we were, athwart the air malign;</div>
<div>My passionate prayer such influence possessed.</div>
<div>'O living creature, gracious and benign,</div>
<div>Us visiting in this obscured air,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Who did the earth with blood incarnadine;</div>
<div>If in the favour of the King we were</div>
<div>Who rules the world, we for thy peace would pray,</div>
<div>Since our misfortunes thy compassion stir.</div>
<div>Whate'er now pleases thee to hear or say</div>
<div>We listen to, or tell, at your demand;</div>
<div>While yet the wind, as now, doth silent stay.</div>
<div>My native city lies upon the strand</div>
<div>Where to the sea descends the river Po</div>
<div>For peace, with all his tributary band.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Love, in a generous heart set soon aglow,</div>
<div>Seized him for the fair form was mine above;</div>
<div>And still it irks me to have lost it so.</div>
<div>Love, which absolves no one beloved from love,</div>
<div>So strong a passion for him in me wrought</div>
<div>That, as thou seest, I still its mastery prove.</div>
<div>Love led us where we in one death were caught.</div>
<div>For him who slew us waits Caina now.'</div>
<div>Unto our ears these words from them were brought.</div>
<div>When I had heard these troubled souls, my brow</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>I downward bent, and long while musing stayed,</div>
<div>Until the Poet asked: 'What thinkest thou?'</div>
<div>And when I answered him, 'Alas!' I said,</div>
<div>'Sweet thoughts how many, and what strong desire,</div>
<div>These to their sad catastrophe betrayed!'</div>
<div>Then, turned once more to them, I to inquire</div>
<div>Began: 'Francesca, these thine agonies</div>
<div>Me with compassion unto tears inspire.</div>
<div>But tell me, at the season of sweet sighs</div>
<div>What sign made love, and what the means he chose</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>To strip your dubious longings of disguise?'</div>
<div>And she to me: 'The bitterest of woes</div>
<div>Is to remember in the midst of pain</div>
<div>A happy past; as well thy teacher knows.</div>
<div>Yet none the less, and since thou art so fain</div>
<div>The first occasion of our love to hear,</div>
<div>Like one I speak that cannot tears restrain.</div>
<div>As we for pastime one day reading were</div>
<div>How Lancelot by love was fettered fast--</div>
<div>All by ourselves and without any fear--</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Moved by the tale our eyes we often cast</div>
<div>On one another, and our colour fled;</div>
<div>But one word was it, vanquished us at last.</div>
<div>When how the smile, long wearied for, we read</div>
<div>Was kissed by him who loved like none before,</div>
<div>This one, who henceforth never leaves me, laid</div>
<div>A kiss on my mouth, trembling the while all o'er.</div>
<div>The book was Galahad, and he as well</div>
<div>Who wrote the book. That day we read no more.'</div>
<div>And while one shade continued thus to tell,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>The other wept so bitterly, I swooned</div>
<div>Away for pity, and as dead I fell:</div>
<div>Yea, as a corpse falls, fell I on the ground.</div>
<h2>CANTO VI.</h2>
<div>When I regained my senses, which had fled</div>
<div>At my compassion for the kindred two,</div>
<div>Which for pure sorrow quite had turned my head,</div>
<div>New torments and a crowd of sufferers new</div>
<div>I see around me as I move again,</div>
<div>Where'er I turn, where'er I bend my view.</div>
<div>In the Third Circle am I of the rain</div>
<div>Which, heavy, cold, eternal, big with woe,</div>
<div>Doth always of one kind and force remain.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Large hail and turbid water, mixed with snow,</div>
<div>Keep pouring down athwart the murky air;</div>
<div>And from the ground they fall on, stenches grow.</div>
<div>The savage Cerberus, a monster drear,</div>
<div>Howls from his threefold throat with canine cries</div>
<div>Above the people who are whelmed there.</div>
<div>Oily and black his beard, and red his eyes,</div>
<div>His belly huge: claws from his fingers sprout.</div>
<div>The shades he flays, hooks, rends in cruel wise.</div>
<div>Beat by the rain these, dog-like, yelp and shout,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>And shield themselves in turn with either side;</div>
<div>And oft the wretched sinners turn about.</div>
<div>When we by Cerberus, great worm, were spied,</div>
<div>He oped his mouths and all his fangs he showed,</div>
<div>While not a limb did motionless abide.</div>
<div>My Leader having spread his hands abroad,</div>
<div>Filled both his fists with earth ta'en from the ground,</div>
<div>And down the ravening gullets flung the load.</div>
<div>Then, as sharp set with hunger barks the hound,</div>
<div>But is appeased when at his meat he gnaws,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>And, worrying it, forgets all else around;</div>
<div>So with those filthy faces there it was</div>
<div>Of the fiend Cerberus, who deafs the crowd</div>
<div>Of souls till they from hearing fain would pause.</div>
<div>We, travelling o'er the spirits who lay cowed</div>
<div>And sorely by the grievous showers harassed,</div>
<div>Upon their semblances of bodies trod.</div>
<div>Prone on the ground the whole of them were cast,</div>
<div>Save one of them who sat upright with speed</div>
<div>When he beheld that near to him we passed.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>'O thou who art through this Inferno led,</div>
<div>Me if thou canst,' he asked me, 'recognise;</div>
<div>For ere I was dismantled thou wast made.'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'Thy present tortured guise</div>
<div>Perchance hath blurred my memory of thy face,</div>
<div>Until it seems I ne'er on thee set eyes.</div>
<div>But tell me who thou art, within this place</div>
<div>So cruel set, exposed to such a pain,</div>
<div>Than which, if greater, none has more disgrace.'</div>
<div>And he: 'Thy city, swelling with the bane</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Of envy till the sack is running o'er,</div>
<div>Me in the life serene did once contain.</div>
<div>As Ciacco me your citizens named of yore;</div>
<div>And for the damning sin of gluttony</div>
<div>I, as thou seest, am beaten by this shower.</div>
<div>No solitary woful soul am I,</div>
<div>For all of these endure the selfsame doom</div>
<div>For the same fault.' Here ended his reply.</div>
<div>I answered him, 'O Ciacco, with such gloom</div>
<div>Thy misery weighs me, I to weep am prone;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>But, if thou canst, declare to what shall come</div>
<div>The citizens of the divided town.</div>
<div>Holds it one just man? And declare the cause</div>
<div>Why 'tis of discord such a victim grown.'</div>
<div>Then he to me: 'After contentious pause</div>
<div>Blood will be spilt; the boorish party then</div>
<div>Will chase the others forth with grievous loss.</div>
<div>The former it behoves to fall again</div>
<div>Within three suns, the others to ascend,</div>
<div>Holpen by him whose wiles ere now are plain.</div>
<div>Long time, with heads held high, they'll make to bend</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">71</aside>The other party under burdens dire,</div>
<div>Howe'er themselves in tears and rage they spend.</div>
<div>There are two just men, at whom none inquire.</div>
<div>Envy, and pride, and avarice, even these</div>
<div>Are the three sparks have set all hearts on fire.'</div>
<div>With this the tearful sound he made to cease:</div>
<div>And I to him, 'Yet would I have thee tell--</div>
<div>And of thy speech do thou the gift increase--</div>
<div>Tegghiaio and Farinata, honourable,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>James Rusticucci, Mosca, Arrigo,</div>
<div>With all the rest so studious to excel</div>
<div>In good; where are they? Help me this to know;</div>
<div>Great hunger for the news hath seized me;</div>
<div>Delights them Heaven, or tortures Hell below?'</div>
<div>He said: 'Among the blackest souls they be;</div>
<div>Them to the bottom weighs another sin.</div>
<div>Shouldst thou so far descend, thou mayst them see.</div>
<div>But when the sweet world thou again dost win,</div>
<div>I pray thee bring me among men to mind;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>No more I tell, nor new reply begin.'</div>
<div>Then his straightforward eyes askance declined;</div>
<div>He looked at me a moment ere his head</div>
<div>He bowed; then fell flat 'mong the other blind.</div>
<div>'Henceforth he waketh not,' my Leader said,</div>
<div>'Till he shall hear the angel's trumpet sound,</div>
<div>Ushering the hostile Judge. By every shade</div>
<div>Its dismal sepulchre shall then be found,</div>
<div>Its flesh and ancient form it shall resume,</div>
<div>And list what echoes in eternal round.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>So passed we where the shades and rainy spume</div>
<div>Made filthy mixture, with steps taken slow;</div>
<div>Touching a little on the world to come.</div>
<div>Wherefore I said: 'Master, shall torments grow</div>
<div>After the awful sentence hath been heard,</div>
<div>Or lesser prove and not so fiercely glow?'</div>
<div>'Repair unto thy Science,' was his word;</div>
<div>'Which tells, as things approach a perfect state</div>
<div>To keener joy or suffering they are stirred.</div>
<div>Therefore although this people cursed by fate</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Ne'er find perfection in its full extent,</div>
<div>To it they then shall more approximate</div>
<div>Than now.' Our course we round the circle bent,</div>
<div>Still holding speech, of which I nothing say,</div>
<div>Until we came where down the pathway went:</div>
<div>There found we Plutus, the great enemy.</div>
<h2>CANTO VII.</h2>
<div>Pape Satan! Pape Satan! Aleppe!</div>
<div>Plutus began in accents rough and hard:</div>
<div>And that mild Sage, all-knowing, said to me,</div>
<div>For my encouragement: 'Pay no regard</div>
<div>Unto thy fear; whatever power he sways</div>
<div>Thy passage down this cliff shall not be barred.'</div>
<div>Then turning round to that inflamed face</div>
<div>He bade: 'Accursed wolf, at peace remain;</div>
<div>And, pent within thee, let thy fury blaze.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Down to the pit we journey not in vain:</div>
<div>So rule they where by Michael in Heaven's height</div>
<div>On the adulterous pride was vengeance ta'en.'</div>
<div>Then as the bellied sails, by wind swelled tight,</div>
<div>Suddenly drag whenever snaps the mast;</div>
<div>Such, falling to the ground, the monster's plight.</div>
<div>To the Fourth Cavern so we downward passed,</div>
<div>Winning new reaches of the doleful shore</div>
<div>Where all the vileness of the world is cast.</div>
<div>Justice of God! which pilest more and more</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Pain as I saw, and travail manifold!</div>
<div>Why will we sin, to be thus wasted sore?</div>
<div>As at Charybdis waves are forward rolled</div>
<div>To break on other billows midway met,</div>
<div>The people here a counterdance must hold.</div>
<div>A greater crowd than I had seen as yet,</div>
<div>With piercing yells advanced on either track,</div>
<div>Rolling great stones to which their chests were set.</div>
<div>They crashed together, and then each turned back</div>
<div>Upon the way he came, while shouts arise,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>'Why clutch it so?' and 'Why to hold it slack?'</div>
<div>In the dark circle wheeled they on this wise</div>
<div>From either hand to the opposing part,</div>
<div>Where evermore they raised insulting cries.</div>
<div>Thither arrived, each, turning, made fresh start</div>
<div>Through the half circle a new joust to run;</div>
<div>And I, stung almost to the very heart,</div>
<div>Said, 'O my Master, wilt thou make it known</div>
<div>Who the folk are? Were these all clerks who go</div>
<div>Before us on the left, with shaven crown?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And he replied: 'All of them squinted so</div>
<div>In mental vision while in life they were,</div>
<div>They nothing spent by rule. And this they show,</div>
<div>And with their yelping voices make appear</div>
<div>When half-way round the circle they have sped,</div>
<div>And sins opposing them asunder tear.</div>
<div>Each wanting thatch of hair upon his head</div>
<div>Was once a clerk, or pope, or cardinal,</div>
<div>In whom abound the ripest growths of greed.'</div>
<div>And I: 'O Master, surely among all</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Of these I ought some few to recognise,</div>
<div>Who by such filthy sins were held in thrall.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Vain thoughts within thee rise;</div>
<div>Their witless life, which made them vile, now mocks--</div>
<div>Dimming their faces still--all searching eyes.</div>
<div>Eternally they meet with hostile shocks;</div>
<div>These rising from the tomb at last shall stand</div>
<div>With tight clenched fists, and those with ruined locks.</div>
<div>Squandering or hoarding, they the happy land</div>
<div>Have lost, and now are marshalled for this fray;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Which to describe doth no fine words demand.</div>
<div>Know hence, my Son, how fleeting is the play</div>
<div>Of goods at the dispose of Fortune thrown,</div>
<div>And which mankind to such fierce strife betray.</div>
<div>Not all the gold which is beneath the moon</div>
<div>Could purchase peace, nor all that ever was,</div>
<div>To but one soul of these by toil undone.'</div>
<div>'Master,' I said, 'tell thou, ere making pause,</div>
<div>Who Fortune is of whom thou speak'st askance,</div>
<div>Who holds all worldly riches in her claws.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>'O foolish creatures, lost in ignorance!'</div>
<div>He answer made. 'Now see that the reply</div>
<div>Thou store, which I concerning her advance.</div>
<div>He who in knowledge is exalted high,</div>
<div>Framing all Heavens gave such as should them guide,</div>
<div>That so each part might shine to all; whereby</div>
<div>Is equal light diffused on every side:</div>
<div>And likewise to one guide and governor,</div>
<div>Of worldly splendours did control confide,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">79</aside>That she in turns should different peoples dower</div>
<div>With this vain good; from blood should make it pass</div>

<div>According to her absolute decree</div>
<div>Which hidden lurks, like serpent in the grass.</div>
<div>Vain 'gainst her foresight yours must ever be.</div>
<div>She makes provision, judges, holds her reign,</div>
<div>As doth his power supreme each deity.</div>
<div>Her permutations can no truce sustain;</div>
<div>Necessity compels her to be swift,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>So swift they follow who their turn must gain.</div>
<div>And this is she whom they so often lift</div>
<div>Upon the cross, who ought to yield her praise;</div>
<div>And blame on her and scorn unjustly shift.</div>
<div>But she is blest nor hears what any says,</div>
<div>With other primal creatures turns her sphere,</div>
<div>Jocund and glad, rejoicing in her ways.</div>
<div>To greater woe now let us downward steer.</div>
<div>The stars which rose when I began to guide</div>
<div>Are falling now, nor may we linger here.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>We crossed the circle to the other side,</div>
<div>Arriving where a boiling fountain fell</div>
<div>Into a brooklet by its streams supplied.</div>
<div>In depth of hue the flood did perse excel,</div>
<div>And we, with this dim stream to lead us on,</div>
<div>Descended by a pathway terrible.</div>
<div>A marsh which by the name of Styx is known,</div>
<div>Fed by this gloomy brook, lies at the base</div>
<div>Of threatening cliffs hewn out of cold grey stone.</div>
<div>And I, intent on study of the place,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Saw people in that ditch, mud-smeared. In it</div>
<div>All naked stood with anger-clouded face.</div>
<div>Nor with their fists alone each fiercely hit</div>
<div>The other, but with feet and chest and head,</div>
<div>And with their teeth to shreds each other bit.</div>
<div>'Son, now behold,' the worthy Master said,</div>
<div>'The souls of those whom anger made a prize;</div>
<div>And, further, I would have thee certified</div>
<div>That 'neath the water people utter sighs,</div>
<div>And make the bubbles to the surface come;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>As thou mayst see by casting round thine eyes.</div>
<div>Fixed in the mud they say: "We lived in gloom</div>
<div>In the sweet air made jocund by the day,</div>
<div>Nursing within us melancholy fume.</div>
<div>In this black mud we now our gloom display."</div>
<div>This hymn with gurgling throats they strive to sound,</div>
<div>Which they in speech unbroken fail to say.'</div>
<div>And thus about the loathsome pool we wound</div>
<div>For a wide arc, between the dry and soft,</div>
<div>With eyes on those who gulp the filth, turned round.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>At last we reached a tower that soared aloft.</div>
<h2>CANTO VIII.</h2>
<div>I say, continuing, that long before</div>
<div>To its foundations we approached nigh</div>
<div>Our eyes went travelling to the top of the tower;</div>
<div>For, hung out there, two flames we could espy.</div>
<div>Then at such distance, scarce our eyesight made</div>
<div>It clearly out, another gave reply.</div>
<div>And, to the Sea of Knowledge turned, I said:</div>
<div>'What meaneth this? and what reply would yield</div>
<div>That other light, and who have it displayed?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>'Thou shouldst upon the impure watery field,'</div>
<div>He said, 'already what approaches know,</div>
<div>But that the fen-fog holds it still concealed.'</div>
<div>Never was arrow yet from sharp-drawn bow</div>
<div>Urged through the air upon a swifter flight</div>
<div>Than what I saw a tiny vessel show,</div>
<div>Across the water shooting into sight;</div>
<div>A single pilot served it for a crew,</div>
<div>Who shouted: 'Art thou come, thou guilty sprite?'</div>
<div>'O Phlegyas, Phlegyas, this thy loud halloo!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>For once,' my Lord said, 'idle is and vain.</div>
<div>Thou hast us only till the mud we're through.'</div>
<div>And, as one cheated inly smarts with pain</div>
<div>When the deceit wrought on him is betrayed,</div>
<div>His gathering ire could Phlegyas scarce contain.</div>
<div>Into the bark my Leader stepped, and made</div>
<div>Me take my place beside him; nor a jot,</div>
<div>Till I had entered, was it downward weighed.</div>
<div>Soon as my Guide and I were in the boat,</div>
<div>To cleave the flood began the ancient prow,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Deeper than 'tis with others wont to float.</div>
<div>Then, as the stagnant ditch we glided through,</div>
<div>One smeared with filth in front of me arose</div>
<div>And said: 'Thus coming ere thy period, who</div>
<div>Art thou?' And I: 'As one who forthwith goes</div>
<div>I come; but thou defiled, how name they thee?'</div>
<div>'I am but one who weeps,' he said. 'With woes,'</div>
<div>I answered him, 'with tears and misery,</div>
<div>Accursed soul, remain; for thou art known</div>
<div>Unto me now, all filthy though thou be.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Then both his hands were on the vessel thrown;</div>
<div>But him my wary Master backward heaved,</div>
<div>Saying: 'Do thou 'mong the other dogs be gone!'</div>
<div>Then to my neck with both his arms he cleaved,</div>
<div>And kissed my face, and, 'Soul disdainful,' said,</div>
<div>'O blessed she in whom thou wast conceived!</div>
<div>He in the world great haughtiness displayed.</div>
<div>No deeds of worth his memory adorn;</div>
<div>And therefore rages here his sinful shade.</div>
<div>And many are there by whom crowns are worn</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>On earth, shall wallow here like swine in mire,</div>
<div>Leaving behind them names o'erwhelmed in scorn.'</div>
<div>And I: 'O Master, I have great desire</div>
<div>To see him well soused in this filthy tide,</div>
<div>Ere from the lake we finally retire.'</div>
<div>And he: 'Or ever shall have been descried</div>
<div>The shore by thee, thy longing shall be met;</div>
<div>For such a wish were justly gratified.'</div>
<div>A little after in such fierce onset</div>
<div>The miry people down upon him bore,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>I praise and bless God for it even yet.</div>
<div>'Philip Argenti! at him!' was the roar;</div>
<div>And then that furious spirit Florentine</div>
<div>Turned with his teeth upon himself and tore.</div>
<div>Here was he left, nor wins more words of mine.</div>
<div>Now in my ears a lamentation rung,</div>
<div>Whence I to search what lies ahead begin.</div>
<div>And the good Master told me: 'Son, ere long</div>
<div>We to the city called of Dis draw near,</div>
<div>Where in great armies cruel burghers throng.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And I: 'Already, Master, I appear</div>
<div>Mosques in the valley to distinguish well,</div>
<div>Vermilion, as if they from furnace were</div>
<div>Fresh come.' And he: 'Fires everlasting dwell</div>
<div>Within them, whence appear they glowing hot,</div>
<div>As thou discernest in this lower hell.'</div>
<div>We to the moat profound at length were brought,</div>
<div>Which girds that city all disconsolate;</div>
<div>The walls around it seemed of iron wrought.</div>
<div>Not without fetching first a compass great,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>We came to where with angry cry at last:</div>
<div>'Get out,' the boatman yelled; 'behold the gate!'</div>
<div>More than a thousand, who from Heaven were cast,</div>
<div>I saw above the gates, who furiously</div>
<div>Demanded: 'Who, ere death on him has passed,</div>
<div>Holds through the region of the dead his way?'</div>
<div>And my wise Master made to them a sign</div>
<div>That he had something secretly to say.</div>
<div>Then ceased they somewhat from their great disdain,</div>
<div>And said: 'Come thou, but let that one be gone</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Who thus presumptuous enters on this reign.</div>
<div>Let him retrace his madcap way alone,</div>
<div>If he but can; thou meanwhile lingering here,</div>
<div>Through such dark regions who hast led him down.'</div>
<div>Judge, reader, if I was not filled with fear,</div>
<div>Hearing the words of this accursed threat;</div>
<div>For of return my hopes extinguished were.</div>
<div>'Beloved Guide, who more than seven times set</div>
<div>Me in security, and safely brought</div>
<div>Through frightful dangers in my progress met,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Leave me not thus undone;' I him besought:</div>
<div>'If further progress be to us denied,</div>
<div>Let us retreat together, tarrying not.'</div>
<div>The Lord who led me thither then replied:</div>
<div>'Fear not: by One so great has been assigned</div>
<div>Our passage, vainly were all hindrance tried.</div>
<div>Await me here, and let thy fainting mind</div>
<div>Be comforted and with good hope be fed,</div>
<div>Not to be left in this low world behind.'</div>
<div>Thus goes he, thus am I abandoned</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>By my sweet Father. I in doubt remain,</div>
<div>With Yes and No contending in my head.</div>
<div>I could not hear what speech he did maintain,</div>
<div>But no long time conferred he in that place,</div>
<div>Till, to be first, all inward raced again.</div>
<div>And then the gates were closed in my Lord's face</div>
<div>By these our enemies; outside stood he;</div>
<div>Then backward turned to me with lingering pace,</div>
<div>With downcast eyes, and all the bravery</div>
<div>Stripped from his brows; and he exclaimed with sighs;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>'Who dare deny the doleful seats to me!'</div>
<div>And then he said: 'Although my wrath arise,</div>
<div>Fear not, for I to victory will pursue,</div>
<div>Howe'er within they plot, the enterprise.</div>
<div>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;</div>
<div>They showed it once at a less secret door</div>
<div>Which stands unbolted since. Thou didst it view,</div>
<div>And saw the dark-writ legend which it bore.</div>
<div>Thence, even now, is one who hastens down</div>
<div>Through all the circles, guideless, to this shore,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>And he shall win us entrance to the town.'</div>
<h2>CANTO IX.</h2>
<div>The hue which cowardice on my face did paint</div>
<div>When I beheld my guide return again,</div>
<div>Put his new colour quicker 'neath restraint.</div>
<div>Like one who listens did he fixed remain;</div>
<div>For far to penetrate the air like night,</div>
<div>And heavy mist, the eye was bent in vain.</div>
<div>'Yet surely we must vanquish in the fight;'</div>
<div>Thus he, 'unless--but with such proffered aid--</div>
<div>O how I weary till he come in sight!'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Well I remarked how he transition made,</div>
<div>Covering his opening words with those behind,</div>
<div>Which contradicted what at first he said.</div>
<div>Nath'less his speech with terror charged my mind,</div>
<div>For, haply, to the word which broken fell</div>
<div>Worse meaning than he purposed, I assigned.</div>
<div>Down to this bottom of the dismal shell</div>
<div>Comes ever any from the First Degree,</div>
<div>Where all their pain is, stripped of hope to dwell?</div>
<div>To this my question thus responded he:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>'Seldom it haps to any to pursue</div>
<div>The journey now embarked upon by me.</div>
<div>Yet I ere this descended, it is true,</div>
<div>Beneath a spell of dire Erichtho's laid,</div>
<div>Who could the corpse with soul inform anew.</div>
<div>Short while my flesh of me was empty made</div>
<div>When she required me to o'erpass that wall,</div>
<div>From Judas' circle to abstract a shade.</div>
<div>That is the deepest, darkest place of all,</div>
<div>And furthest from the heaven which moves the skies;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>I know the way; fear nought that can befall.</div>
<div>These fens from which vile exhalations rise</div>
<div>The doleful city all around invest,</div>
<div>Which now we reach not save in angry wise.'</div>
<div>Of more he spake nought in my mind doth rest,</div>
<div>For, with mine eyes, my every thought had been</div>
<div>Fixed on the lofty tower with flaming crest,</div>
<div>Where, in a moment and upright, were seen</div>
<div>Three hellish furies, all with blood defaced,</div>
<div>And woman-like in members and in mien.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Hydras of brilliant green begirt their waist;</div>
<div>Snakes and cerastes for their tresses grew,</div>
<div>And these were round their dreadful temples braced.</div>
<div>That they the drudges were, full well he knew,</div>
<div>Of her who is the queen of endless woes,</div>
<div>And said to me: 'The fierce Erynnyes view!</div>
<div>Herself upon the left Megaera shows;</div>
<div>That is Alecto weeping on the right;</div>
<div>Tisiphone's between.' Here made he close.</div>
<div>Each with her nails her breast tore, and did smite</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Herself with open palms. They screamed in tone</div>
<div>So fierce, I to the Poet clove for fright.</div>
<div>'Medusa, come, that we may make him stone!'</div>
<div>All shouted as they downward gazed; 'Alack!</div>
<div>Theseus escaped us when he ventured down.'</div>
<div>'Keep thine eyes closed and turn to them thy back,</div>
<div>For if the Gorgon chance to be displayed</div>
<div>And thou shouldst look, farewell the upward track!'</div>
<div>Thus spake the Master, and himself he swayed</div>
<div>Me round about; nor put he trust in mine</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>But his own hands upon mine eyelids laid.</div>
<div>O ye with judgment gifted to divine</div>
<div>Look closely now, and mark what hidden lore</div>
<div>Lies 'neath the veil of my mysterious line!</div>
<div>Across the turbid waters came a roar</div>
<div>And crash of sound, which big with fear arose:</div>
<div>Because of it fell trembling either shore.</div>
<div>The fashion of it was as when there blows</div>
<div>A blast by cross heats made to rage amain,</div>
<div>Which smites the forest and without repose</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>The shattered branches sweeps in hurricane;</div>
<div>In clouds of dust, majestic, onward flies,</div>
<div>Wild beasts and herdsmen driving o'er the plain.</div>
<div>'Sharpen thy gaze,' he bade--and freed mine eyes--</div>
<div>'Across the foam-flecked immemorial lake,</div>
<div>Where sourest vapour most unbroken lies.'</div>
<div>And as the frogs before the hostile snake</div>
<div>Together of the water get them clear,</div>
<div>And on the dry ground, huddling, shelter take;</div>
<div>More than a thousand ruined souls in fear</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Beheld I flee from one who, dry of feet,</div>
<div>Was by the Stygian ferry drawing near.</div>
<div>Waving his left hand he the vapour beat</div>
<div>Swiftly from 'fore his face, nor seemed he spent</div>
<div>Save with fatigue at having this to meet.</div>
<div>Well I opined that he from Heaven was sent,</div>
<div>And to my Master turned. His gesture taught</div>
<div>I should be dumb and in obeisance bent.</div>
<div>Ah me, how with disdain appeared he fraught!</div>
<div>He reached the gate, which, touching with a rod,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>He oped with ease, for it resisted not.</div>
<div>'People despised and banished far from God,'</div>
<div>Upon the awful threshold then he spoke,</div>
<div>'How holds in you such insolence abode?</div>
<div>Why kick against that will which never broke</div>
<div>Short of its end, if ever it begin,</div>
<div>And often for you fiercer torments woke?</div>
<div>Butting 'gainst fate, what can ye hope to win?</div>
<div>Your Cerberus, as is to you well known,</div>
<div>Still bears for this a well-peeled throat and chin.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Then by the passage foul he back was gone,</div>
<div>Nor spake to us, but like a man was he</div>
<div>By other cares absorbed and driven on</div>
<div>Than that of those who may around him be.</div>
<div>And we, confiding in the sacred word,</div>
<div>Moved toward the town in all security.</div>
<div>We entered without hindrance, and I, spurred</div>
<div>By my desire the character to know</div>
<div>And style of place such strong defences gird,</div>
<div>Entering, begin mine eyes around to throw,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>And see on every hand a vast champaign,</div>
<div>The teeming seat of torments and of woe.</div>
<div>And as at Arles where Rhone spreads o'er the plain,</div>
<div>Or Pola, hard upon Quarnaro sound</div>
<div>Which bathes the boundaries Italian,</div>
<div>The sepulchres uneven make the ground;</div>
<div>So here on every side, but far more dire</div>
<div>And grievous was the fashion of them found.</div>
<div>For scattered 'mid the tombs blazed many a fire,</div>
<div>Because of which these with such fervour burned</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>No arts which work in iron more require.</div>
<div>All of the lids were lifted. I discerned</div>
<div>By keen laments which from the tombs arose</div>
<div>That sad and suffering ones were there inurned.</div>
<div>I said: 'O Master, tell me who are those</div>
<div>Buried within the tombs, of whom the sighs</div>
<div>Come to our ears thus eloquent of woes?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'The lords of heresies</div>
<div>With followers of all sects, a greater band</div>
<div>Than thou wouldst think, these sepulchres comprise.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>To lodge them like to like the tombs are planned.</div>
<div>The sepulchres have more or less of heat.'</div>
<div>Then passed we, turning to the dexter hand,</div>
<div>'Tween torments and the lofty parapet.</div>
<h2>CANTO X.</h2>
<div>And now advance we by a narrow track</div>
<div>Between the torments and the ramparts high,</div>
<div>My Master first, and I behind his back.</div>
<div>'O mighty Virtue, at whose will am I</div>
<div>Wheeled through these impious circles,' then I said,</div>
<div>'Speak, and in full my longing satisfy.</div>
<div>The people who within the tombs are laid,</div>
<div>May they be seen? The coverings are all thrown</div>
<div>Open, nor is there any guard displayed.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>And he to me: 'All shall be fastened down</div>
<div>When hither from Jehoshaphat they come</div>
<div>Again in bodies which were once their own.</div>
<div>All here with Epicurus find their tomb</div>
<div>Who are his followers, and by whom 'tis held</div>
<div>That the soul shares the body's mortal doom.</div>
<div>Things here discovered then shall answer yield,</div>
<div>And quickly, to thy question asked of me;</div>
<div>As well as to the wish thou hast concealed.'</div>
<div>And I: 'Good Leader, if I hide from thee</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>My heart, it is that I may little say;</div>
<div>Nor only now learned I thus dumb to be.'</div>
<div>'O Tuscan, who, still living, mak'st thy way,</div>
<div>Modest of speech, through the abode of flame,</div>
<div>Be pleased a little in this place to stay.</div>
<div>The accents of thy language thee proclaim</div>
<div>To be a native of that state renowned</div>
<div>Which I, perchance, wronged somewhat.' Sudden came</div>
<div>These words from out a tomb which there was found</div>
<div>'Mongst others; whereon I, compelled by fright,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>A little toward my Leader shifted ground.</div>
<div>And he: 'Turn round, what ails thee? Lo! upright</div>
<div>Beginneth Farinata to arise;</div>
<div>All of him 'bove the girdle comes in sight.'</div>
<div>On him already had I fixed mine eyes.</div>
<div>Towering erect with lifted front and chest,</div>
<div>He seemed Inferno greatly to despise.</div>
<div>And toward him I among the tombs was pressed</div>
<div>By my Guide's nimble and courageous hand,</div>
<div>While he, 'Choose well thy language,' gave behest.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Beneath his tomb when I had ta'en my stand</div>
<div>Regarding me a moment, 'Of what house</div>
<div>Art thou?' as if in scorn, he made demand.</div>
<div>To show myself obedient, anxious,</div>
<div>I nothing hid, but told my ancestors;</div>
<div>And, listening, he gently raised his brows.</div>
<div>'Fiercely to me they proved themselves adverse,</div>
<div>And to my sires and party,' then he said;</div>
<div>'Because of which I did them twice disperse.'</div>
<div>I answered him: 'And what although they fled!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Twice from all quarters they returned with might,</div>
<div>An art not mastered yet by these you led.'</div>
<div>Beside him then there issued into sight</div>
<div>Another shade, uncovered to the chin,</div>
<div>Propped on his knees, if I surmised aright.</div>
<div>He peered around as if he fain would win</div>
<div>Knowledge if any other was with me;</div>
<div>And then, his hope all spent, did thus begin,</div>
<div>Weeping: 'By dint of genius if it be</div>
<div>Thou visit'st this dark prison, where my son?</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And wherefore not found in thy company?'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'I come not here alone:</div>
<div>He waiting yonder guides me: but disdain</div>
<div>Of him perchance was by your Guido shown.'</div>
<div>The words he used, and manner of his pain,</div>
<div>Revealed his name to me beyond surmise;</div>
<div>Hence was I able thus to answer plain.</div>
<div>Then cried he, and at once upright did rise,</div>
<div>'How saidst thou--was? Breathes he not then the air?</div>
<div>The pleasant light no longer smites his eyes?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>When he of hesitation was aware</div>
<div>Displayed by me in forming my reply,</div>
<div>He fell supine, no more to reappear.</div>
<div>But the magnanimous, at whose bidding I</div>
<div>Had halted there, the same expression wore,</div>
<div>Nor budged a jot, nor turned his neck awry.</div>
<div>'And if'--resumed he where he paused before--</div>
<div>'They be indeed but slow that art to learn,</div>
<div>Than this my bed, to hear it pains me more.</div>
<div>But ere the fiftieth time anew shall burn</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>The lady's face who reigneth here below,</div>
<div>Of that sore art thou shalt experience earn.</div>
<div>And as to the sweet world again thou'dst go,</div>
<div>Tell me, why is that people so without</div>
<div>Ruth for my race, as all their statutes show?'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'The slaughter and the rout</div>
<div>Which made the Arbia to run with red,</div>
<div>Cause in our fane such prayers to be poured out.'</div>
<div>Whereon he heaved a sigh and shook his head:</div>
<div>'There I was not alone, nor to embrace</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>That cause was I, without good reason, led.</div>
<div>But there I was alone, when from her place</div>
<div>All granted Florence should be swept away.</div>
<div>'Twas I defended her with open face.'</div>
<div>'So may your seed find peace some better day,'</div>
<div>I urged him, 'as this knot you shall untie</div>
<div>In which my judgment doth entangled stay.</div>
<div>If I hear rightly, ye, it seems, descry</div>
<div>Beforehand what time brings, and yet ye seem</div>
<div>'Neath other laws as touching what is nigh.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>'Like those who see best what is far from them,</div>
<div>We see things,' said he, 'which afar remain;</div>
<div>Thus much enlightened by the Guide Supreme.</div>
<div>To know them present or approaching, vain</div>
<div>Are all our powers; and save what they relate</div>
<div>Who hither come, of earth no news we gain.</div>
<div>Hence mayst thou gather in how dead a state</div>
<div>Shall all our knowledge from that time be thrown</div>
<div>When of the future shall be closed the gate.'</div>
<div>Then, for my fault as if repentant grown,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>I said: 'Report to him who fell supine,</div>
<div>That still among the living breathes his son.</div>
<div>And if I, dumb, seemed answer to decline,</div>
<div>Tell him it was that I upon the knot</div>
<div>Was pondering then, you helped me to untwine.'</div>
<div>Me now my Master called, whence I besought</div>
<div>With more than former sharpness of the shade,</div>
<div>To tell me what companions he had got.</div>
<div>He answered me: 'Some thousand here are laid</div>
<div>With me; 'mong these the Second Frederick,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>The Cardinal too; of others nought be said.'</div>
<div>Then was he hid; and towards the Bard antique</div>
<div>I turned my steps, revolving in my brain</div>
<div>The ominous words which I had heard him speak.</div>
<div>He moved, and as we onward went again</div>
<div>Demanded of me: 'Wherefore thus amazed?'</div>
<div>And to his question I made answer plain.</div>
<div>'Within thy mind let there be surely placed,'</div>
<div>The Sage bade, 'what 'gainst thee thou heardest say.</div>
<div>Now mark me well' (his finger here he raised),</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>'When thou shalt stand within her gentle ray</div>
<div>Whose beauteous eye sees all, she will make known</div>
<div>The stages of thy journey on life's way.'</div>
<div>Turning his feet, he to the left moved on;</div>
<div>Leaving the wall, we to the middle went</div>
<div>Upon a path that to a vale strikes down,</div>
<div>Which even to us above its foulness sent.</div>
<h2>CANTO XI.</h2>
<div>We at the margin of a lofty steep</div>
<div>Made of great shattered stones in circle bent,</div>
<div>Arrived where worser torments crowd the deep.</div>
<div>So horrible a stench and violent</div>
<div>Was upward wafted from the vast abyss,</div>
<div>Behind the cover we for shelter went</div>
<div>Of a great tomb where I saw written this:</div>
<div>'Pope Anastasius is within me thrust,</div>
<div>Whom the straight way Photinus made to miss.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>'Now on our course a while we linger must,'</div>
<div>The Master said, 'be but our sense resigned</div>
<div>A little to it, and the filthy gust</div>
<div>We shall not heed.' Then I: 'Do thou but find</div>
<div>Some compensation lest our time should run</div>
<div>Wasted.' And he: 'Behold, 'twas in my mind.</div>
<div>Girt by the rocks before us, O my son,</div>
<div>Lie three small circles,' he began to tell,</div>
<div>'Graded like those with which thou now hast done,</div>
<div>All of them filled with spirits miserable.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>That sight of them may thee henceforth suffice.</div>
<div>Hear how and wherefore in these groups they dwell.</div>
<div>Whate'er in Heaven's abhorred as wickedness</div>
<div>Has injury for its end; in others' bane</div>
<div>By fraud resulting or in violent wise.</div>
<div>Since fraud to man alone doth appertain,</div>
<div>God hates it most; and hence the fraudulent band,</div>
<div>Set lowest down, endure a fiercer pain.</div>
<div>Of the violent is the circle next at hand</div>
<div>To us; and since three ways is violence shown,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>'Tis in three several circuits built and planned.</div>
<div>To God, ourselves, or neighbours may be done</div>
<div>Violence, or on the things by them possessed;</div>
<div>As reasoning clear shall unto thee make known.</div>
<div>Our neighbour may by violence be distressed</div>
<div>With grievous wounds, or slain; his goods and lands</div>
<div>By havoc, fire, and plunder be oppressed.</div>
<div>Hence those who wound and slay with violent hands,</div>
<div>Robbers, and spoilers, in the nearest round</div>
<div>Are all tormented in their various bands.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Violent against himself may man be found,</div>
<div>And 'gainst his goods; therefore without avail</div>
<div>They in the next are in repentance drowned</div>
<div>Who on themselves loss of your world entail,</div>
<div>Who gamble and their substance madly spend,</div>
<div>And who when called to joy lament and wail.</div>
<div>And even to God may violence extend</div>
<div>By heart denial and by blasphemy,</div>
<div>Scorning what nature doth in bounty lend.</div>
<div>Sodom and Cahors hence are doomed to lie</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Within the narrowest circlet surely sealed;</div>
<div>And such as God within their hearts defy.</div>
<div>Fraud, 'gainst whose bite no conscience findeth shield,</div>
<div>A man may use with one who in him lays</div>
<div>Trust, or with those who no such credence yield.</div>
<div>Beneath this latter kind of it decays</div>
<div>The bond of love which out of nature grew;</div>
<div>Hence, in the second circle herd the race</div>
<div>To feigning given and flattery, who pursue</div>
<div>Magic, false coining, theft, and simony,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Pimps, barrators, and suchlike residue.</div>
<div>The other form of fraud makes nullity</div>
<div>Of natural bonds; and, what is more than those,</div>
<div>The special trust whence men on men rely.</div>
<div>Hence in the place whereon all things repose,</div>
<div>The narrowest circle and the seat of Dis,</div>
<div>Each traitor's gulfed in everlasting woes.'</div>
<div>'Thy explanation, Master, as to this</div>
<div>Is clear,' I said, 'and thou hast plainly told</div>
<div>Who are the people stowed in the abyss.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>But tell why those the muddy marshes hold,</div>
<div>The tempest-driven, those beaten by the rain,</div>
<div>And such as, meeting, virulently scold,</div>
<div>Are not within the crimson city ta'en</div>
<div>For punishment, if hateful unto God;</div>
<div>And, if not hateful, wherefore doomed to pain?'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Why wander thus abroad,</div>
<div>More than is wont, thy wits? or how engrossed</div>
<div>Is now thy mind, and on what things bestowed?</div>
<div>Hast thou the memory of the passage lost</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>In which thy Ethics for their subject treat</div>
<div>Of the three moods by Heaven abhorred the most--</div>
<div>Malice and bestiality complete;</div>
<div>And how, compared with these, incontinence</div>
<div>Offends God less, and lesser blame doth meet?</div>
<div>If of this doctrine thou extract the sense,</div>
<div>And call to memory what people are</div>
<div>Above, outside, in endless penitence,</div>
<div>Why from these guilty they are sundered far</div>
<div>Thou shalt discern, and why on them alight</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>The strokes of justice in less angry war.'</div>
<div>'O Sun that clearest every troubled sight,</div>
<div>So charmed am I by thy resolving speech,</div>
<div>Doubt yields me joy no less than knowing right.</div>
<div>Therefore, I pray, a little backward reach,'</div>
<div>I asked, 'to where thou say'st that usury</div>
<div>Sins 'gainst God's bounty; and this mystery teach.'</div>
<div>He said: 'Who gives ear to Philosophy</div>
<div>Is taught by her, nor in one place alone,</div>

<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Even Mind Divine, and art which thence hath grown;</div>
<div>And if thy Physics thou wilt search within,</div>

<div>This art by yours, far as your art can win,</div>
<div>Is followed close--the teacher by the taught;</div>
<div>As grandchild then to God your art is kin.</div>
<div>And from these two--do thou recall to thought</div>
<div>How Genesis begins--should come supplies</div>
<div>Of food for man, and other wealth be sought.</div>
<div>And, since another plan the usurer plies,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Nature and nature's child have his disdain;</div>
<div>Because on other ground his hope relies.</div>
<div>But come, for to advance I now am fain:</div>
<div>The Fishes over the horizon line</div>
<div>Quiver; o'er Caurus now stands all the Wain;</div>
<div>And further yonder does the cliff decline.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XII.</h2>
<div>The place of our descent before us lay</div>
<div>Precipitous, and there was something more</div>
<div>From sight of which all eyes had turned away.</div>
<div>As at the ruin which upon the shore</div>
<div>Of Adige fell upon this side of Trent--</div>
<div>Through earthquake or by slip of what before</div>
<div>Upheld it--from the summit whence it went</div>
<div>Far as the plain, the shattered rocks supply</div>
<div>Some sort of foothold to who makes descent;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Such was the passage down the precipice high.</div>
<div>And on the riven gully's very brow</div>
<div>Lay spread at large the Cretan Infamy</div>
<div>Which was conceived in the pretended cow.</div>
<div>Us when he saw, he bit himself for rage</div>
<div>Like one whose anger gnaws him through and through.</div>
<div>'Perhaps thou deemest,' called to him the Sage,</div>
<div>'This is the Duke of Athens drawing nigh,</div>
<div>Who war to the death with thee on earth did wage.</div>
<div>Begone, thou brute, for this one passing by</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Untutored by thy sister has thee found,</div>
<div>And only comes thy sufferings to spy,'</div>
<div>And as the bull which snaps what held it bound</div>
<div>On being smitten by the fatal blow,</div>
<div>Halts in its course, and reels upon the ground,</div>
<div>The Minotaur I saw reel to and fro;</div>
<div>And he, the alert, cried: 'To the passage haste;</div>
<div>While yet he chafes 'twere well thou down shouldst go.'</div>
<div>So we descended by the slippery waste</div>
<div>Of shivered stones which many a time gave way</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>'Neath the new weight my feet upon them placed.</div>
<div>I musing went; and he began to say:</div>
<div>'Perchance this ruined slope thou thinkest on,</div>
<div>Watched by the brute rage I did now allay.</div>
<div>But I would have thee know, when I came down</div>
<div>The former time into this lower Hell,</div>
<div>The cliff had not this ruin undergone.</div>
<div>It was not long, if I distinguish well,</div>
<div>Ere He appeared who wrenched great prey from Dis</div>
<div>From out the upmost circle. Trembling fell</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Through all its parts the nauseous abyss</div>
<div>With such a violence, the world, I thought,</div>
<div>Was stirred by love; for, as they say, by this</div>
<div>She back to Chaos has been often brought.</div>
<div>And then it was this ancient rampart strong</div>
<div>Was shattered here and at another spot.</div>
<div>But toward the valley look. We come ere long</div>
<div>Down to the river of blood where boiling lie</div>
<div>All who by violence work others wrong.'</div>
<div>O insane rage! O blind cupidity!</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>By which in our brief life we are so spurred,</div>
<div>Ere downward plunged in evil case for aye!</div>
<div>An ample ditch I now beheld engird</div>
<div>And sweep in circle all around the plain,</div>
<div>As from my Escort I had lately heard.</div>
<div>Between this and the rock in single train</div>
<div>Centaurs were running who were armed with bows,</div>
<div>As if they hunted on the earth again.</div>
<div>Observing us descend they all stood close,</div>
<div>Save three of them who parted from the band</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>With bow, and arrows they in coming chose.</div>
<div>'What torment,' from afar one made demand,</div>
<div>'Come ye to share, who now descend the hill?</div>
<div>I shoot unless ye answer whence ye stand.'</div>
<div>My Master said: 'We yield no answer till</div>
<div>We come to Chiron standing at thy side;</div>
<div>But thy quick temper always served thee ill.'</div>
<div>Then touching me: ''Tis Nessus; he who died</div>
<div>With love for beauteous Dejanire possessed,</div>
<div>And who himself his own vendetta plied.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>He in the middle, staring on his breast,</div>
<div>Is mighty Chiron, who Achilles bred;</div>
<div>And next the wrathful Pholus. They invest</div>
<div>The fosse and in their thousands round it tread,</div>
<div>Shooting whoever from the blood shall lift,</div>
<div>More than his crime allows, his guilty head.'</div>
<div>As we moved nearer to those creatures swift</div>
<div>Chiron drew forth a shaft and dressed his beard</div>
<div>Back on his jaws, using the arrow's cleft.</div>
<div>And when his ample mouth of hair was cleared,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>He said to his companions: 'Have ye seen</div>
<div>The things the second touches straight are stirred,</div>
<div>As they by feet of shades could ne'er have been?'</div>
<div>And my good Guide, who to his breast had gone--</div>
<div>The part where join the natures, 'Well I ween</div>
<div>He lives,' made answer; 'and if, thus alone,</div>
<div>He seeks the valley dim 'neath my control,</div>
<div>Necessity, not pleasure, leads him on.</div>
<div>One came from where the alleluiahs roll,</div>
<div>Who charged me with this office strange and new:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>No robber he, nor mine a felon soul.</div>
<div>But, by that Power which makes me to pursue</div>
<div>The rugged journey whereupon I fare,</div>
<div>Accord us one of thine to keep in view,</div>
<div>That he may show where lies the ford, and bear</div>
<div>This other on his back to yonder strand;</div>
<div>No spirit he, that he should cleave the air.'</div>
<div>Wheeled to the right then Chiron gave command</div>
<div>To Nessus: 'Turn, and lead them, and take tent</div>
<div>They be not touched by any other band.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>We with our trusty Escort forward went,</div>
<div>Threading the margin of the boiling blood</div>
<div>Where they who seethed were raising loud lament.</div>
<div>People I saw up to the chin imbrued,</div>
<div>'These all are tyrants,' the great Centaur said,</div>
<div>'Who blood and plunder for their trade pursued.</div>
<div>Here for their pitiless deeds tears now are shed</div>
<div>By Alexander, and Dionysius fell,</div>
<div>Through whom in Sicily dolorous years were led.</div>
<div>The forehead with black hair so terrible</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Is Ezzelino; that one blond of hue,</div>
<div>Obizzo d'Este, whom, as rumours tell,</div>
<div>His stepson murdered, and report speaks true.'</div>
<div>I to the Poet turned, who gave command:</div>
<div>'Regard thou chiefly him. I follow you.'</div>
<div>Ere long the Centaur halted on the strand,</div>
<div>Close to a people who, far as the throat,</div>
<div>Forth of that bulicame seemed to stand.</div>
<div>Thence a lone shade to us he pointed out</div>
<div>Saying: 'In God's house ran he weapon through</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>The heart which still on Thames wins cult devout.'</div>
<div>Then I saw people, some with heads in view,</div>
<div>And some their chests above the river bore;</div>
<div>And many of them I, beholding, knew.</div>
<div>And thus the blood went dwindling more and more,</div>
<div>Until at last it covered but the feet:</div>
<div>Here took we passage to the other shore.</div>
<div>'As on this hand thou seest still abate</div>
<div>In depth the volume of the boiling stream,'</div>
<div>The Centaur said, 'so grows its depth more great,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Believe me, towards the opposite extreme,</div>
<div>Until again its circling course attains</div>
<div>The place where tyrants must lament. Supreme</div>
<div>Justice upon that side involves in pains,</div>
<div>With Attila, once of the world the pest,</div>
<div>Pyrrhus and Sextus: and for ever drains</div>
<div>Tears out of Rinier of Corneto pressed</div>
<div>And Rinier Pazzo in that boiling mass,</div>
<div>Whose brigandage did so the roads infest.'</div>
<div>Then turned he back alone, the ford to pass.</div>
<h2>CANTO XIII.</h2>
<div>Ere Nessus landed on the other shore</div>
<div>We for our part within a forest drew,</div>
<div>Which of no pathway any traces bore.</div>
<div>Not green the foliage, but of dusky hue;</div>
<div>Not smooth the boughs, but gnarled and twisted round;</div>
<div>For apples, poisonous thorns upon them grew.</div>
<div>No rougher brakes or matted worse are found</div>
<div>Where savage beasts betwixt Corneto roam</div>
<div>And Cecina, abhorring cultured ground.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>The loathsome Harpies nestle here at home,</div>
<div>Who from the Strophades the Trojans chased</div>
<div>With dire predictions of a woe to come.</div>
<div>Great winged are they, but human necked and faced,</div>
<div>With feathered belly, and with claw for toe;</div>
<div>They shriek upon the bushes wild and waste.</div>
<div>'Ere passing further, I would have thee know,'</div>
<div>The worthy Master thus began to say,</div>
<div>'Thou'rt in the second round, nor hence shalt go</div>
<div>Till by the horrid sand thy footsteps stay.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Give then good heed, and things thou'lt recognise</div>
<div>That of my words will prove the verity.'</div>
<div>Wailings on every side I heard arise:</div>
<div>Of who might raise them I distinguished nought;</div>
<div>Whereon I halted, smitten with surprise.</div>
<div>I think he thought that haply 'twas my thought</div>
<div>The voices came from people 'mong the trees,</div>
<div>Who, to escape us, hiding-places sought;</div>
<div>Wherefore the Master said: 'From one of these</div>
<div>Snap thou a twig, and thou shalt understand</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>How little with thy thought the fact agrees.'</div>
<div>Thereon a little I stretched forth my hand</div>
<div>And plucked a tiny branch from a great thorn.</div>
<div>'Why dost thou tear me?' made the trunk demand.</div>
<div>When dark with blood it had begun to turn,</div>
<div>It cried a second time: 'Why wound me thus?</div>
<div>Doth not a spark of pity in thee burn?</div>
<div>Though trees we be, once men were all of us;</div>
<div>Yet had our souls the souls of serpents been</div>
<div>Thy hand might well have proved more piteous.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>As when the fire hath seized a fagot green</div>
<div>At one extremity, the other sighs,</div>
<div>And wind, escaping, hisses; so was seen,</div>
<div>At where the branch was broken, blood to rise</div>
<div>And words were mixed with it. I dropped the spray</div>
<div>And stood like one whom terror doth surprise.</div>
<div>The Sage replied: 'Soul vexed with injury,</div>
<div>Had he been only able to give trust</div>
<div>To what he read narrated in my lay,</div>
<div>His hand toward thee would never have been thrust.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>'Tis hard for faith; and I, to make it plain,</div>
<div>Urged him to trial, mourn it though I must.</div>
<div>But tell him who thou wast; so shall remain</div>
<div>This for amends to thee, thy fame shall blow</div>
<div>Afresh on earth, where he returns again.'</div>
<div>And then the trunk: 'Thy sweet words charm me so,</div>
<div>I cannot dumb remain; nor count it hard</div>
<div>If I some pains upon my speech bestow.</div>
<div>For I am he who held both keys in ward</div>
<div>Of Frederick's heart, and turned them how I would,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And softly oped it, and as softly barred,</div>
<div>Till scarce another in his counsel stood.</div>
<div>To my high office I such loyalty bore,</div>
<div>It cost me sleep and haleness of my blood.</div>
<div>The harlot who removeth nevermore</div>
<div>From Caesar's house eyes ignorant of shame--</div>
<div>A common curse, of courts the special sore--</div>
<div>Set against me the minds of all aflame,</div>
<div>And these in turn Augustus set on fire,</div>
<div>Till my glad honours bitter woes became.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>My soul, filled full with a disdainful ire,</div>
<div>Thinking by means of death disdain to flee,</div>
<div>'Gainst my just self unjustly did conspire.</div>
<div>I swear even by the new roots of this tree</div>
<div>My fealty to my lord I never broke,</div>
<div>For worthy of all honour sure was he.</div>
<div>If one of you return 'mong living folk,</div>
<div>Let him restore my memory, overthrown</div>
<div>And suffering yet because of envy's stroke.'</div>
<div>Still for a while the poet listened on,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Then said: 'Now he is dumb, lose not the hour,</div>
<div>But make request if more thou'dst have made known.'</div>
<div>And I replied: 'Do thou inquire once more</div>
<div>Of what thou thinkest I would gladly know;</div>
<div>I cannot ask; ruth wrings me to the core.'</div>
<div>On this he spake: 'Even as the man shall do,</div>
<div>And liberally, what thou of him hast prayed,</div>
<div>Imprisoned spirit, do thou further show</div>
<div>How with these knots the spirits have been made</div>
<div>Incorporate; and, if thou canst, declare</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>If from such members e'er is loosed a shade.'</div>
<div>Then from the trunk came vehement puffs of air;</div>
<div>Next, to these words converted was the wind:</div>
<div>'My answer to you shall be short and clear.</div>
<div>When the fierce soul no longer is confined</div>
<div>In flesh, torn thence by action of its own,</div>
<div>To the Seventh Depth by Minos 'tis consigned.</div>
<div>No choice is made of where it shall be thrown</div>
<div>Within the wood; but where by chance 'tis flung</div>
<div>It germinates like seed of spelt that's sown.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>A forest tree it grows from sapling young;</div>
<div>Eating its leaves, the Harpies cause it pain,</div>
<div>And open loopholes whence its sighs are wrung.</div>
<div>We for our vestments shall return again</div>
<div>Like others, but in them shall ne'er be clad:</div>
<div>Men justly lose what from themselves they've ta'en.</div>
<div>Dragged hither by us, all throughout the sad</div>
<div>Forest our bodies shall be hung on high;</div>
<div>Each on the thorn of its destructive shade.'</div>
<div>While to the trunk we listening lingered nigh,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Thinking he might proceed to tell us more,</div>
<div>A sudden uproar we were startled by</div>
<div>Like him who, that the huntsman and the boar</div>
<div>To where he stands are sweeping in the chase,</div>
<div>Knows by the crashing trees and brutish roar.</div>
<div>Upon our left we saw a couple race</div>
<div>Naked and scratched; and they so quickly fled</div>
<div>The forest barriers burst before their face.</div>
<div>'Speed to my rescue, death!' the foremost pled.</div>
<div>The next, as wishing he could use more haste;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>'Not thus, O Lano, thee thy legs bested</div>
<div>When one at Toppo's tournament thou wast.'</div>
<div>Then, haply wanting breath, aside he stepped,</div>
<div>Merged with a bush on which himself he cast.</div>
<div>Behind them through the forest onward swept</div>
<div>A pack of dogs, black, ravenous, and fleet,</div>
<div>Like greyhounds from their leashes newly slipped.</div>
<div>In him who crouched they made their teeth to meet,</div>
<div>And, having piecemeal all his members rent,</div>
<div>Haled them away enduring anguish great.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Grasping my hand, my Escort forward went</div>
<div>And led me to the bush which, all in vain,</div>
<div>Through its ensanguined openings made lament.</div>
<div>'James of St. Andrews,' it we heard complain;</div>
<div>'What profit hadst thou making me thy shield?</div>
<div>For thy bad life doth blame to me pertain?'</div>
<div>Then, halting there, this speech my Master held:</div>
<div>'Who wast thou that through many wounds dost sigh,</div>
<div>Mingled with blood, words big with sorrow swelled?'</div>
<div>'O souls that hither come,' was his reply,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>'To witness shameful outrage by me borne,</div>
<div>Whence all my leaves torn off around me lie,</div>
<div>Gather them to the root of this drear thorn.</div>
<div>My city for the Baptist changed of yore</div>
<div>Her former patron; wherefore, in return,</div>
<div>He with his art will make her aye deplore;</div>
<div>And were it not some image doth remain</div>
<div>Of him where Arno's crossed from shore to shore,</div>
<div>Those citizens who founded her again</div>
<div>On ashes left by Attila, had spent</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>Their labour of a surety all in vain.</div>
<div>In my own house I up a gibbet went.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XIV.</h2>
<div>Me of my native place the dear constraint</div>
<div>Led to restore the leaves which round were strewn,</div>
<div>To him whose voice by this time was grown faint.</div>
<div>Thence came we where the second round joins on</div>
<div>Unto the third, wherein how terrible</div>
<div>The art of justice can be, is well shown.</div>
<div>But, clearly of these wondrous things to tell,</div>
<div>I say we entered on a plain of sand</div>
<div>Which from its bed doth every plant repel.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>The dolorous wood lies round it like a band,</div>
<div>As that by the drear fosse is circled round.</div>
<div>Upon its very edge we came to a stand.</div>
<div>And there was nothing within all that bound</div>
<div>But burnt and heavy sand; like that once trod</div>
<div>Beneath the feet of Cato was the ground.</div>
<div>Ah, what a terror, O revenge of God!</div>
<div>Shouldst thou awake in any that may read</div>
<div>Of what before mine eyes was spread abroad.</div>
<div>I of great herds of naked souls took heed.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Most piteously was weeping every one;</div>
<div>And different fortunes seemed to them decreed.</div>
<div>For some of them upon the ground lay prone,</div>
<div>And some were sitting huddled up and bent,</div>
<div>While others, restless, wandered up and down.</div>
<div>More numerous were they that roaming went</div>
<div>Than they that were tormented lying low;</div>
<div>But these had tongues more loosened to lament.</div>
<div>O'er all the sand, deliberate and slow,</div>
<div>Broad open flakes of fire were downward rained,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>As 'mong the Alps in calm descends the snow.</div>
<div>Such Alexander saw when he attained</div>
<div>The hottest India; on his host they fell</div>
<div>And all unbroken on the earth remained;</div>
<div>Wherefore he bade his phalanxes tread well</div>
<div>The ground, because when taken one by one</div>
<div>The burning flakes they could the better quell.</div>
<div>So here eternal fire was pouring down;</div>
<div>As tinder 'neath the steel, so here the sands</div>
<div>Kindled, whence pain more vehement was known.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And, dancing up and down, the wretched hands</div>
<div>Beat here and there for ever without rest;</div>
<div>Brushing away from them the falling brands.</div>
<div>And I: 'O Master, by all things confessed</div>
<div>Victor, except by obdurate evil powers</div>
<div>Who at the gate to stop our passage pressed,</div>
<div>Who is the enormous one who noway cowers</div>
<div>Beneath the fire; with fierce disdainful air</div>
<div>Lying as if untortured by the showers?'</div>
<div>And that same shade, because he was aware</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>That touching him I of my Guide was fain</div>
<div>To learn, cried: 'As in life, myself I bear</div>
<div>In death. Though Jupiter should tire again</div>
<div>His smith, from whom he snatched in angry bout</div>
<div>The bolt by which I at the last was slain;</div>
<div>Though one by one he tire the others out</div>
<div>At the black forge in Mongibello placed,</div>
<div>While "Ho, good Vulcan, help me!" he shall shout--</div>
<div>The cry he once at Phlegra's battle raised;</div>
<div>Though hurled with all his might at me shall fly</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>His bolts, yet sweet revenge he shall not taste.'</div>
<div>Then spake my Guide, and in a voice so high</div>
<div>Never till then heard I from him such tone:</div>
<div>'O Capaneus, because unquenchably</div>
<div>Thy pride doth burn, worse pain by thee is known.</div>
<div>Into no torture save thy madness wild</div>
<div>Fit for thy fury couldest thou be thrown.'</div>
<div>Then, to me turning with a face more mild,</div>
<div>He said: 'Of the Seven Kings was he of old,</div>
<div>Who leaguered Thebes, and as he God reviled</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Him in small reverence still he seems to hold;</div>
<div>But for his bosom his own insolence</div>
<div>Supplies fit ornament, as now I told.</div>
<div>Now follow; but take heed lest passing hence</div>
<div>Thy feet upon the burning sand should tread;</div>
<div>But keep them firm where runs the forest fence.'</div>
<div>We reached a place--nor any word we said--</div>
<div>Where issues from the wood a streamlet small;</div>
<div>I shake but to recall its colour red.</div>
<div>Like that which does from Bulicame fall,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>And losel women later 'mong them share;</div>
<div>So through the sand this brooklet's waters crawl.</div>
<div>Its bottom and its banks I was aware</div>
<div>Were stone, and stone the rims on either side.</div>
<div>From this I knew the passage must be there.</div>
<div>'Of all that I have shown thee as thy guide</div>
<div>Since when we by the gateway entered in,</div>
<div>Whose threshold unto no one is denied,</div>
<div>Nothing by thee has yet encountered been</div>
<div>So worthy as this brook to cause surprise,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>O'er which the falling fire-flakes quenched are seen.'</div>
<div>These were my Leader's words. For full supplies</div>
<div>I prayed him of the food of which to taste</div>
<div>Keen appetite he made within me rise.</div>
<div>'In middle sea there lies a country waste,</div>
<div>Known by the name of Crete,' I then was told,</div>
<div>'Under whose king the world of yore was chaste.</div>
<div>There stands a mountain, once the joyous hold</div>
<div>Of woods and streams; as Ida 'twas renowned,</div>
<div>Now 'tis deserted like a thing grown old.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>For a safe cradle 'twas by Rhea found.</div>
<div>To nurse her child in; and his infant cry,</div>
<div>Lest it betrayed him, she with clamours drowned.</div>
<div>Within the mount an old man towereth high.</div>
<div>Towards Damietta are his shoulders thrown;</div>
<div>On Rome, as on his mirror, rests his eye.</div>
<div>His head is fashioned of pure gold alone;</div>
<div>Of purest silver are his arms and chest;</div>
<div>'Tis brass to where his legs divide; then down</div>
<div>From that is all of iron of the best,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Save the right foot, which is of baken clay;</div>
<div>And upon this foot doth he chiefly rest.</div>
<div>Save what is gold, doth every part display</div>
<div>A fissure dripping tears; these, gathering all</div>
<div>Together, through the grotto pierce a way.</div>
<div>From rock to rock into this deep they fall,</div>
<div>Feed Acheron and Styx and Phlegethon,</div>
<div>Then downward travelling by this strait canal,</div>
<div>Far as the place where further slope is none,</div>
<div>Cocytus form; and what that pool may be</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>I say not now. Thou'lt see it further on.'</div>
<div>'If this brook rises,' he was asked by me,</div>
<div>'Within our world, how comes it that no trace</div>
<div>We saw of it till on this boundary?'</div>
<div>And he replied: 'Thou knowest that the place</div>
<div>Is round, and far as thou hast moved thy feet,</div>
<div>Still to the left hand sinking to the base,</div>
<div>Nath'less thy circuit is not yet complete.</div>
<div>Therefore if something new we chance to spy,</div>
<div>Amazement needs not on thy face have seat.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>I then: 'But, Master, where doth Lethe lie,</div>
<div>And Phlegethon? Of that thou sayest nought;</div>
<div>Of this thou say'st, those tears its flood supply.'</div>
<div>'It likes me well to be by thee besought;</div>
<div>But by the boiling red wave,' I was told,</div>
<div>'To half thy question was an answer brought.</div>
<div>Lethe, not in this pit, shalt thou behold.</div>
<div>Thither to wash themselves the spirits go,</div>
<div>When penitence has made them spotless souled.'</div>
<div>Then said he: 'From the wood 'tis fitting now</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>That we depart; behind me press thou nigh.</div>
<div>Keep we the margins, for they do not glow,</div>
<div>And over them, ere fallen, the fire-flakes die.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XV.</h2>
<div>Now lies our way along one of the margins hard;</div>
<div>Steam rising from the rivulet forms a cloud,</div>
<div>Which 'gainst the fire doth brook and borders guard.</div>
<div>Like walls the Flemings, timorous of the flood</div>
<div>Which towards them pours betwixt Bruges and Cadsand,</div>
<div>Have made, that ocean's charge may be withstood;</div>
<div>Or what the Paduans on the Brenta's strand</div>
<div>To guard their castles and their homesteads rear,</div>
<div>Ere Chiarentana feel the spring-tide bland;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Of the same fashion did those dikes appear,</div>
<div>Though not so high he made them, nor so vast,</div>
<div>Whoe'er the builder was that piled them here.</div>
<div>We, from the wood when we so far had passed</div>
<div>I should not have distinguished where it lay</div>
<div>Though I to see it backward glance had cast,</div>
<div>A group of souls encountered on the way,</div>
<div>Whose line of march was to the margin nigh.</div>
<div>Each looked at us--as by the new moon's ray</div>
<div>Men peer at others 'neath the darkening sky--</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Sharpening his brows on us and only us,</div>
<div>Like an old tailor on his needle's eye.</div>
<div>And while that crowd was staring at me thus,</div>
<div>One of them knew me, caught me by the gown,</div>
<div>And cried aloud: 'Lo, this is marvellous!'</div>
<div>And straightway, while he thus to me held on,</div>
<div>I fixed mine eyes upon his fire-baked face,</div>
<div>And, spite of scorching, seemed his features known,</div>
<div>And whose they were my memory well could trace;</div>
<div>And I, with hand stretched toward his face below,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Asked: 'Ser Brunetto! and is this your place?'</div>
<div>'O son,' he answered, 'no displeasure show,</div>
<div>If now Brunetto Latini shall some way</div>
<div>Step back with thee, and leave his troop to go.'</div>
<div>I said: 'With all my heart for this I pray,</div>
<div>And, if you choose, I by your side will sit;</div>
<div>If he, for I go with him, grant delay.'</div>
<div>'Son,' said he, 'who of us shall intermit</div>
<div>Motion a moment, for an age must lie</div>
<div>Nor fan himself when flames are round him lit.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>On, therefore! At thy skirts I follow nigh,</div>
<div>Then shall I overtake my band again,</div>
<div>Who mourn a loss large as eternity.'</div>
<div>I dared not from the path step to the plain</div>
<div>To walk with him, but low I bent my head,</div>
<div>Like one whose steps are all with reverence ta'en.</div>
<div>'What fortune or what destiny,' he said,</div>
<div>'Hath brought thee here or e'er thou death hast seen;</div>
<div>And who is this by whom thou'rt onward led?'</div>
<div>'Up yonder,' said I, 'in the life serene,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>I in a valley wandered all forlorn</div>
<div>Before my years had full accomplished been.</div>
<div>I turned my back on it but yestermorn;</div>
<div>Again I sought it when he came in sight</div>
<div>Guided by whom I homeward thus return.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'Following thy planet's light</div>
<div>Thou of a glorious haven canst not fail,</div>
<div>If in the blithesome life I marked aright.</div>
<div>And had my years known more abundant tale,</div>
<div>Seeing the heavens so held thee in their grace</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>I, heartening thee, had helped thee to prevail.</div>
<div>But that ungrateful and malignant race</div>
<div>Which down from Fiesole came long ago,</div>
<div>And still its rocky origin betrays,</div>
<div>Will for thy worthiness become thy foe;</div>
<div>And with good reason, for 'mong crab-trees wild</div>
<div>It ill befits the mellow fig to grow.</div>
<div>By widespread ancient rumour are they styled</div>
<div>A people blind, rapacious, envious, vain:</div>
<div>See by their manners thou be not defiled.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Fortune reserves such honour for thee, fain</div>
<div>Both sides will be to enlist thee in their need;</div>
<div>But from the beak the herb shall far remain.</div>
<div>Let beasts of Fiesole go on to tread</div>
<div>Themselves to litter, nor the plants molest,</div>
<div>If any such now spring on their rank bed,</div>
<div>In whom there flourishes indeed the blest</div>
<div>Seed of the Romans who still lingered there</div>
<div>When of such wickedness 'twas made the nest.'</div>
<div>'Had I obtained full answer to my prayer,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>You had not yet been doomed,' I then did say,</div>
<div>'This exile from humanity to bear.</div>
<div>For deep within my heart and memory</div>
<div>Lives the paternal image good and dear</div>
<div>Of you, as in the world, from day to day,</div>
<div>How men escape oblivion you made clear;</div>
<div>My thankfulness for which shall in my speech</div>
<div>While I have life, as it behoves, appear.</div>
<div>I note what of my future course you teach.</div>
<div>Stored with another text it will be glozed</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>By one expert, should I that Lady reach.</div>
<div>Yet would I have this much to you disclosed:</div>
<div>If but my conscience no reproaches yield,</div>
<div>To all my fortune is my soul composed.</div>
<div>Not new to me the hint by you revealed;</div>
<div>Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel apace,</div>
<div>Even as she will; the clown his mattock wield.'</div>
<div>Thereon my Master right about did face,</div>
<div>And uttered this, with glance upon me thrown:</div>
<div>'He hears to purpose who doth mark the place.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And none the less I, speaking, still go on</div>
<div>With Ser Brunetto; asking him to tell</div>
<div>Who of his band are greatest and best known.</div>
<div>And he to me: 'To hear of some is well,</div>
<div>But of the rest 'tis fitting to be dumb,</div>
<div>And time is lacking all their names to spell.</div>
<div>That all of them were clerks, know thou in sum,</div>
<div>All men of letters, famous and of might;</div>
<div>Stained with one sin all from the world are come.</div>
<div>Priscian goes with that crowd of evil plight,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Francis d'Accorso too; and hadst thou mind</div>
<div>For suchlike trash thou mightest have had sight</div>
<div>Of him the Slave of Slaves to change assigned</div>
<div>From Arno's banks to Bacchiglione, where</div>
<div>His nerves fatigued with vice he left behind.</div>
<div>More would I say, but neither must I fare</div>
<div>Nor talk at further length, for from the sand</div>
<div>I see new dust-clouds rising in the air,</div>
<div>I may not keep with such as are at hand.</div>
<div>Care for my Treasure; for I still survive</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>In that my work. I nothing else demand.'</div>
<div>Then turned he back, and ran like those who strive</div>
<div>For the Green Cloth upon Verona's plain;</div>
<div>And seemed like him that shall the first arrive,</div>
<div>And not like him that labours all in vain.</div>
<h2>CANTO XVI.</h2>
<div>Now could I hear the water as it fell</div>
<div>To the next circle with a murmuring sound</div>
<div>Like what is heard from swarming hives to swell;</div>
<div>When three shades all together with a bound</div>
<div>Burst from a troop met by us pressing on</div>
<div>'Neath rain of that sharp torment. O'er the ground</div>
<div>Toward us approaching, they exclaimed each one:</div>
<div>'Halt thou, whom from thy garb we judge to be</div>
<div>A citizen of our corrupted town.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Alas, what scars I on their limbs did see,</div>
<div>Both old and recent, which the flames had made:</div>
<div>Even now my ruth is fed by memory.</div>
<div>My Teacher halted at their cry, and said:</div>
<div>'Await a while:' and looked me in the face;</div>
<div>'Some courtesy to these were well displayed.</div>
<div>And but that fire--the manner of the place--</div>
<div>Descends for ever, fitting 'twere to find</div>
<div>Rather than them, thee quickening thy pace.'</div>
<div>When we had halted, they again combined</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>In their old song; and, reaching where we stood,</div>
<div>Into a wheel all three were intertwined.</div>
<div>And as the athletes used, well oiled and nude,</div>
<div>To feel their grip and, wary, watch their chance,</div>
<div>Ere they to purpose strike and wrestle could;</div>
<div>So each of them kept fixed on me his glance</div>
<div>As he wheeled round, and in opposing ways</div>
<div>His neck and feet seemed ever to advance.</div>
<div>'Ah, if the misery of this sand-strewn place</div>
<div>Bring us and our petitions in despite,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>One then began, 'and flayed and grimy face;</div>
<div>Let at the least our fame goodwill incite</div>
<div>To tell us who thou art, whose living feet</div>
<div>Thus through Inferno wander without fright.</div>
<div>For he whose footprints, as thou see'st, I beat,</div>
<div>Though now he goes with body peeled and nude,</div>
<div>More than thou thinkest, in the world was great.</div>
<div>The grandson was he of Gualdrada good;</div>
<div>He, Guidoguerra, with his armed hand</div>
<div>Did mighty things, and by his counsel shrewd.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>The other who behind me treads the sand</div>
<div>Is one whose name should on the earth be dear;</div>
<div>For he is Tegghiaio Aldobrand.</div>
<div>And I, who am tormented with them here,</div>
<div>James Rusticucci was; my fierce and proud</div>
<div>Wife of my ruin was chief minister.'</div>
<div>If from the fire there had been any shroud</div>
<div>I should have leaped down 'mong them, nor have earned</div>
<div>Blame, for my Teacher sure had this allowed.</div>
<div>But since I should have been all baked and burned,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Terror prevailed the goodwill to restrain</div>
<div>With which to clasp them in my arms I yearned.</div>
<div>Then I began: ''Twas not contempt but pain</div>
<div>Which your condition in my breast awoke,</div>
<div>Where deeply rooted it will long remain,</div>
<div>When this my Master words unto me spoke,</div>
<div>By which expectancy was in me stirred</div>
<div>That ye who came were honourable folk.</div>
<div>I of your city am, and with my word</div>
<div>Your deeds and honoured names oft to recall</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Delighted, and with joy of them I heard.</div>
<div>To the sweet fruits I go, and leave the gall,</div>
<div>As promised to me by my Escort true;</div>
<div>But first I to the centre down must fall.'</div>
<div>'So may thy soul thy members long endue</div>
<div>With vital power,' the other made reply,</div>
<div>'And after thee thy fame its light renew;</div>
<div>As thou shalt tell if worth and courtesy</div>
<div>Within our city as of yore remain,</div>
<div>Or from it have been wholly forced to fly.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>For William Borsier, one of yonder train,</div>
<div>And but of late joined with us in this woe,</div>
<div>Causeth us with his words exceeding pain.'</div>
<div>'Upstarts, and fortunes suddenly that grow,</div>
<div>Have bred in thee pride and extravagance,</div>
<div>Whence tears, O Florence! thou art shedding now.'</div>
<div>Thus cried I with uplifted countenance.</div>
<div>The three, accepting it for a reply,</div>
<div>Glanced each at each as hearing truth men glance.</div>
<div>And all: 'If others thou shalt satisfy</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>As well at other times at no more cost,</div>
<div>Happy thus at thine ease the truth to cry!</div>
<div>Therefore if thou escap'st these regions lost,</div>
<div>Returning to behold the starlight fair,</div>
<div>Then when "There was I," thou shalt make thy boast,</div>
<div>Something of us do thou 'mong men declare.'</div>
<div>Then broken was the wheel, and as they fled</div>
<div>Their nimble legs like pinions beat the air.</div>
<div>So much as one Amen! had scarce been said</div>
<div>Quicker than what they vanished from our view.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>On this once more the way my Master led.</div>
<div>I followed, and ere long so near we drew</div>
<div>To where the water fell, that for its roar</div>
<div>Speech scarcely had been heard between us two.</div>
<div>And as the stream which of all those which pour</div>
<div>East (from Mount Viso counting) by its own</div>
<div>Course falls the first from Apennine to shore--</div>
<div>As Acquacheta in the uplands known</div>
<div>By name, ere plunging to its bed profound;</div>
<div>Name lost ere by Forli its waters run--</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Above St. Benedict with one long bound,</div>
<div>Where for a thousand would be ample room,</div>
<div>Falls from the mountain to the lower ground;</div>
<div>Down the steep cliff that water dyed in gloom</div>
<div>We found to fall echoing from side to side,</div>
<div>Stunning the ear with its tremendous boom.</div>
<div>There was a cord about my middle tied,</div>
<div>With which I once had thought that I might hold</div>
<div>Secure the leopard with the painted hide.</div>
<div>When this from round me I had quite unrolled</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>To him I handed it, all coiled and tight;</div>
<div>As by my Leader I had first been told.</div>
<div>Himself then bending somewhat toward the right,</div>
<div>He just beyond the edge of the abyss</div>
<div>Threw down the cord, which disappeared from sight.</div>
<div>'That some strange thing will follow upon this</div>
<div>Unwonted signal which my Master's eye</div>
<div>Thus follows,' so I thought, 'can hardly miss.'</div>
<div>Ah, what great caution need we standing by</div>
<div>Those who behold not only what is done,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>But who have wit our hidden thoughts to spy!</div>
<div>He said to me: 'There shall emerge, and soon,</div>
<div>What I await; and quickly to thy view</div>
<div>That which thou dream'st of shall be clearly known.'</div>
<div>From utterance of truth which seems untrue</div>
<div>A man, whene'er he can, should guard his tongue;</div>
<div>Lest he win blame to no transgression due.</div>
<div>Yet now I must speak out, and by the song</div>
<div>Of this my Comedy, Reader, I swear--</div>
<div>So in good liking may it last full long!--</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>I saw a shape swim upward through that air.</div>
<div>All indistinct with gross obscurity,</div>
<div>Enough to fill the stoutest heart with fear:</div>
<div>Like one who rises having dived to free</div>
<div>An anchor grappled on a jagged stone,</div>
<div>Or something else deep hidden in the sea;</div>
<div>With feet drawn in and arms all open thrown.</div>
<h2>CANTO XVII.</h2>
<div>'Behold the monster with the pointed tail,</div>
<div>Who passes mountains and can entrance make</div>
<div>Through arms and walls! who makes the whole world ail,</div>
<div>Corrupted by him!' Thus my Leader spake,</div>
<div>And beckoned him that he should land hard by,</div>
<div>Where short the pathways built of marble break.</div>
<div>And that foul image of dishonesty</div>
<div>Moving approached us with his head and chest,</div>
<div>But to the bank drew not his tail on high.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>His face a human righteousness expressed,</div>
<div>'Twas so benignant to the outward view;</div>
<div>A serpent was he as to all the rest.</div>
<div>On both his arms hair to the arm-pits grew:</div>
<div>On back and chest and either flank were knot</div>
<div>And rounded shield portrayed in various hue;</div>
<div>No Turk or Tartar weaver ever brought</div>
<div>To ground or pattern a more varied dye;</div>
<div>Nor by Arachne was such broidery wrought.</div>
<div>As sometimes by the shore the barges lie</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Partly in water, partly on dry land;</div>
<div>And as afar in gluttonous Germany,</div>
<div>Watching their prey, alert the beavers stand;</div>
<div>So did this worst of brutes his foreparts fling</div>
<div>Upon the stony rim which hems the sand.</div>
<div>All of his tail in space was quivering,</div>
<div>Its poisoned fork erecting in the air,</div>
<div>Which scorpion-like was armed with a sting.</div>
<div>My Leader said: 'Now we aside must fare</div>
<div>A little distance, so shall we attain</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Unto the beast malignant crouching there.'</div>
<div>So we stepped down upon the right, and then</div>
<div>A half score steps to the outer edge did pace,</div>
<div>Thus clearing well the sand and fiery rain.</div>
<div>And when we were hard by him I could trace</div>
<div>Upon the sand a little further on</div>
<div>Some people sitting near to the abyss.</div>
<div>'That what this belt containeth may be known</div>
<div>Completely by thee,' then the Master said;</div>
<div>'To see their case do thou advance alone.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Let thy inquiries be succinctly made.</div>
<div>While thou art absent I will ask of him,</div>
<div>With his strong shoulders to afford us aid.'</div>
<div>Then, all alone, I on the outmost rim</div>
<div>Of that Seventh Circle still advancing trod,</div>
<div>Where sat a woful folk. Full to the brim</div>
<div>Their eyes with anguish were, and overflowed;</div>
<div>Their hands moved here and there to win some ease,</div>
<div>Now from the flames, now from the soil which glowed.</div>
<div>No otherwise in summer-time one sees,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Working its muzzle and its paws, the hound</div>
<div>When bit by gnats or plagued with flies or fleas.</div>
<div>And I, on scanning some who sat around</div>
<div>Of those on whom the dolorous flames alight,</div>
<div>Could recognise not one. I only found</div>
<div>A purse hung from the throat of every wight,</div>
<div>Each with its emblem and its special hue;</div>
<div>And every eye seemed feasting on the sight.</div>
<div>As I, beholding them, among them drew,</div>
<div>I saw what seemed a lion's face and mien</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Upon a yellow purse designed in blue.</div>
<div>Still moving on mine eyes athwart the scene</div>
<div>I saw another scrip, blood-red, display</div>
<div>A goose more white than butter could have been.</div>
<div>And one, on whose white wallet blazoned lay</div>
<div>A pregnant sow in azure, to me said:</div>
<div>'What dost thou in this pit? Do thou straightway</div>
<div>Begone; and, seeing thou art not yet dead,</div>
<div>Know that Vitalian, neighbour once of mine,</div>
<div>Shall on my left flank one day find his bed.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>A Paduan I: all these are Florentine;</div>
<div>And oft they stun me, bellowing in my ear:</div>
<div>"Come, Pink of Chivalry, for whom we pine,</div>
<div>Whose is the purse on which three beaks appear:"'</div>
<div>Then he from mouth awry his tongue thrust out</div>
<div>Like ox that licks its nose; and I, in fear</div>
<div>Lest more delay should stir in him some doubt</div>
<div>Who gave command I should not linger long,</div>
<div>Me from those wearied spirits turned about.</div>
<div>I found my Guide, who had already sprung</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Upon the back of that fierce animal:</div>
<div>He said to me: 'Now be thou brave and strong.</div>
<div>By stairs like this we henceforth down must fall.</div>
<div>Mount thou in front, for I between would sit</div>
<div>So thee the tail shall harm not nor appal.'</div>
<div>Like one so close upon the shivering fit</div>
<div>Of quartan ague that his nails grow blue,</div>
<div>And seeing shade he trembles every whit,</div>
<div>I at the hearing of that order grew;</div>
<div>But his threats shamed me, as before the face</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Of a brave lord his man grows valorous too.</div>
<div>On the great shoulders then I took my place,</div>
<div>And wished to say, but could not move my tongue</div>
<div>As I expected: 'Do thou me embrace!'</div>
<div>But he, who other times had helped me 'mong</div>
<div>My other perils, when ascent I made</div>
<div>Sustained me, and strong arms around me flung,</div>
<div>And, 'Geryon, set thee now in motion!' said;</div>
<div>'Wheel widely; let thy downward flight be slow;</div>
<div>Think of the novel burden on thee laid.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>As from the shore a boat begins to go</div>
<div>Backward at first, so now he backward pressed,</div>
<div>And when he found that all was clear below,</div>
<div>He turned his tail where earlier was his breast;</div>
<div>And, stretching it, he moved it like an eel,</div>
<div>While with his paws he drew air toward his chest.</div>
<div>More terror Phaethon could hardly feel</div>
<div>What time he let the reins abandoned fall,</div>
<div>Whence Heaven was fired, as still its tracts reveal;</div>
<div>Nor wretched Icarus, on finding all</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>His plumage moulting as the wax grew hot,</div>
<div>While, 'The wrong road!' his father loud did call;</div>
<div>Than what I felt on finding I was brought</div>
<div>Where nothing was but air and emptiness;</div>
<div>For save the brute I could distinguish nought.</div>
<div>He slowly, slowly swims; to the abyss</div>
<div>Wheeling he makes descent, as I surmise</div>
<div>From wind felt 'neath my feet and in my face.</div>
<div>Already on the right I heard arise</div>
<div>From out the caldron a terrific roar,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Whereon I stretch my head with down-turned eyes.</div>
<div>Terror of falling now oppressed me sore;</div>
<div>Hearing laments, and seeing fires that burned,</div>
<div>My thighs I tightened, trembling more and more.</div>
<div>Earlier I had not by the eye discerned</div>
<div>That we swept downward; scenes of torment now</div>
<div>Seemed drawing nearer wheresoe'er we turned.</div>
<div>And as a falcon (which long time doth go</div>
<div>Upon the wing, not finding lure or prey),</div>
<div>While 'Ha!' the falconer cries, 'descending so!'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Comes wearied back whence swift it soared away;</div>
<div>Wheeling a hundred times upon the road,</div>
<div>Then, from its master far, sulks angrily:</div>
<div>So we, by Geryon in the deep bestowed,</div>
<div>Were 'neath the sheer-hewn precipice set down:</div>
<div>He, suddenly delivered from our load,</div>
<div>Like arrow from the string was swiftly gone.</div>
<h2>CANTO XVIII.</h2>
<div>Of iron colour, and composed of stone,</div>
<div>A place called Malebolge is in Hell,</div>
<div>Girt by a cliff of substance like its own.</div>
<div>In that malignant region yawns a well</div>
<div>Right in the centre, ample and profound;</div>
<div>Of which I duly will the structure tell.</div>
<div>The zone that lies between them, then, is round--</div>
<div>Between the well and precipice hard and high;</div>
<div>Into ten vales divided is the ground.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>As is the figure offered to the eye,</div>
<div>Where numerous moats a castle's towers enclose</div>
<div>That they the walls may better fortify;</div>
<div>A like appearance was made here by those.</div>
<div>And as, again, from threshold of such place</div>
<div>Many a drawbridge to the outworks goes;</div>
<div>So ridges from the precipice's base</div>
<div>Cutting athwart the moats and barriers run,</div>
<div>Till at the well join the extremities.</div>
<div>From Geryon's back when we were shaken down</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>'Twas here we stood, until the Poet's feet</div>
<div>Moved to the left, and I, behind, came on.</div>
<div>New torments on the right mine eyes did meet</div>
<div>With new tormentors, novel woe on woe;</div>
<div>With which the nearer Bolgia was replete.</div>
<div>Sinners, all naked, in the gulf below,</div>
<div>This side the middle met us; while they strode</div>
<div>On that side with us, but more swift did go.</div>
<div>Even so the Romans, that the mighty crowd</div>
<div>Across the bridge, the year of Jubilee,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Might pass with ease, ordained a rule of road--</div>
<div>Facing the Castle, on that side should be</div>
<div>The multitude which to St. Peter's hied;</div>
<div>So to the Mount on this was passage free.</div>
<div>On the grim rocky ground, on either side,</div>
<div>I saw horned devils armed with heavy whip</div>
<div>Which on the sinners from behind they plied.</div>
<div>Ah, how they made the wretches nimbly skip</div>
<div>At the first lashes; no one ever yet</div>
<div>But sought from the second and the third to slip.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And as I onward went, mine eyes were set</div>
<div>On one of them; whereon I called in haste:</div>
<div>'This one already I have surely met!'</div>
<div>Therefore to know him, fixedly I gazed;</div>
<div>And my kind Leader willingly delayed,</div>
<div>While for a little I my course retraced.</div>
<div>On this the scourged one, thinking to evade</div>
<div>My search, his visage bent without avail,</div>
<div>For: 'Thou that gazest on the ground,' I said,</div>
<div>'If these thy features tell trustworthy tale,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Venedico Caccianimico thou!</div>
<div>But what has brought thee to such sharp regale?'</div>
<div>And he, 'I tell it 'gainst my will, I trow,</div>
<div>But thy clear accents to the old world bear</div>
<div>My memory, and make me all avow.</div>
<div>I was the man who Ghisola the fair</div>
<div>To serve the Marquis' evil will led on,</div>
<div>Whatever the uncomely tale declare.</div>
<div>Of Bolognese here weeping not alone</div>
<div>Am I; so full the place of them, to-day</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>'Tween Reno and Savena are not known</div>
<div>So many tongues that Sipa deftly say:</div>
<div>And if of this thou'dst know the reason why,</div>
<div>Think but how greedy were our hearts alway.'</div>
<div>To him thus speaking did a demon cry:</div>
<div>'Pander, begone!' and smote him with his thong;</div>
<div>'Here are no women for thy coin to buy.'</div>
<div>Then, with my Escort joined, I moved along.</div>
<div>Few steps we made until we there had come,</div>
<div>Where from the bank a rib of rock was flung.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>With ease enough up to its top we clomb,</div>
<div>And, turning on the ridge, bore to the right;</div>
<div>And those eternal circles parted from.</div>
<div>When we had reached where underneath the height</div>
<div>A passage opes, yielding the scourged a way,</div>
<div>My Guide bade: 'Tarry, so to hold in sight</div>
<div>Those other spirits born in evil day,</div>
<div>Whose faces until now from thee have been</div>
<div>Concealed, because with ours their progress lay.'</div>
<div>Then from the ancient bridge by us were seen</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>The troop which toward us on that circuit sped,</div>
<div>Chased onward, likewise, by the scourges keen.</div>
<div>And my good Master, ere I asked him, said:</div>
<div>'That lordly one now coming hither, see,</div>
<div>By whom, despite of pain, no tears are shed.</div>
<div>What mien he still retains of majesty!</div>
<div>'Tis Jason, who by courage and by guile</div>
<div>The Colchians of the ram deprived. 'Twas he</div>
<div>Who on his passage by the Lemnian isle,</div>
<div>Where all of womankind with daring hand</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Upon their males had wrought a murder vile,</div>
<div>With loving pledges and with speeches bland</div>
<div>The tender-yeared Hypsipyle betrayed,</div>
<div>Who had herself a fraud on others planned.</div>
<div>Forlorn he left her then, when pregnant made.</div>
<div>That is the crime condemns him to this pain;</div>
<div>And for Medea too is vengeance paid.</div>
<div>Who in his manner cheat compose his train.</div>
<div>Of the first moat sufficient now is known,</div>
<div>And those who in its jaws engulfed remain.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Already had we by the strait path gone</div>
<div>To where 'tis with the second bank dovetailed--</div>
<div>The buttress whence a second arch is thrown.</div>
<div>Here heard we who in the next Bolgia wailed</div>
<div>And puffed for breath; reverberations told</div>
<div>They with their open palms themselves assailed.</div>
<div>The sides were crusted over with a mould</div>
<div>Plastered upon them by foul mists that rise,</div>
<div>And both with eyes and nose a contest hold.</div>
<div>The bottom is so deep, in vain our eyes</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Searched it till further up the bridge we went,</div>
<div>To where the arch o'erhangs what under lies.</div>
<div>Ascended there, our eyes we downward bent,</div>
<div>And I saw people in such ordure drowned,</div>
<div>A very cesspool 'twas of excrement.</div>
<div>And while I from above am searching round,</div>
<div>One with a head so filth-smeared I picked out,</div>
<div>I knew not if 'twas lay, or tonsure-crowned.</div>
<div>'Why then so eager,' asked he with a shout,</div>
<div>'To stare at me of all the filthy crew?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>And I to him: 'Because I scarce can doubt</div>
<div>That formerly thee dry of hair I knew,</div>
<div>Alessio Interminei the Lucchese;</div>
<div>And therefore thee I chiefly hold in view.'</div>
<div>Smiting his head-piece, then, his words were these:</div>
<div>''Twas flattery steeped me here; for, using such,</div>
<div>My tongue itself enough could never please.'</div>
<div>'Now stretch thou somewhat forward, but not much,'</div>
<div>Thereon my Leader bade me, 'and thine eyes</div>
<div>Slowly advance till they her features touch</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>And the dishevelled baggage recognise,</div>
<div>Clawing her yonder with her nails unclean,</div>
<div>Now standing up, now squatting on her thighs.</div>
<div>'Tis harlot Thais, who, when she had been</div>
<div>Asked by her lover, "Am I generous</div>
<div>And worthy thanks?" said, "Greatly so, I ween."</div>
<div>Enough of this place has been seen by us.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XIX.</h2>
<div>O Simon Magus! ye his wretched crew!</div>
<div>The gifts of God, ordained to be the bride</div>
<div>Of righteousness, ye prostitute that you</div>
<div>With gold and silver may be satisfied;</div>
<div>Therefore for you let now the trumpet blow,</div>
<div>Seeing that ye in the Third Bolgia 'bide.</div>
<div>Arrived at the next tomb, we to the brow</div>
<div>Of rock ere this had finished our ascent,</div>
<div>Which hangs true plumb above the pit below.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>What perfect art, O Thou Omniscient,</div>
<div>Is Thine in Heaven and earth and the bad world found!</div>
<div>How justly does Thy power its dooms invent!</div>
<div>The livid stone, on both banks and the ground,</div>
<div>I saw was full of holes on every side,</div>
<div>All of one size, and each of them was round.</div>
<div>No larger seemed they to me nor less wide</div>
<div>Than those within my beautiful St. John</div>
<div>For the baptizers' standing-place supplied;</div>
<div>And one of which, not many years agone,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>I broke to save one drowning; and I would</div>
<div>Have this for seal to undeceive men known.</div>
<div>Out of the mouth of each were seen protrude</div>
<div>A sinner's feet, and of the legs the small</div>
<div>Far as the calves; the rest enveloped stood.</div>
<div>And set on fire were both the soles of all,</div>
<div>Which made their ankles wriggle with such throes</div>
<div>As had made ropes and withes asunder fall.</div>
<div>And as flame fed by unctuous matter goes</div>
<div>Over the outer surface only spread;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>So from their heels it flickered to the toes.</div>
<div>'Master, who is he, tortured more,' I said,</div>
<div>'Than are his neighbours, writhing in such woe;</div>
<div>And licked by flames of deeper-hearted red?'</div>
<div>And he: 'If thou desirest that below</div>
<div>I bear thee by that bank which lowest lies,</div>
<div>Thou from himself his sins and name shalt know.'</div>
<div>And I: 'Thy wishes still for me suffice:</div>
<div>Thou art my Lord, and knowest I obey</div>
<div>Thy will; and dost my hidden thoughts surprise.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>To the fourth barrier then we made our way,</div>
<div>And, to the left hand turning, downward went</div>
<div>Into the narrow hole-pierced cavity;</div>
<div>Nor the good Master caused me make descent</div>
<div>From off his haunch till we his hole were nigh</div>
<div>Who with his shanks was making such lament.</div>
<div>'Whoe'er thou art, soul full of misery,</div>
<div>Set like a stake with lower end upcast,'</div>
<div>I said to him, 'Make, if thou canst, reply.'</div>
<div>I like a friar stood who gives the last</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Shrift to a vile assassin, to his side</div>
<div>Called back to win delay for him fixed fast.</div>
<div>'Art thou arrived already?' then he cried,</div>
<div>'Art thou arrived already, Boniface?</div>
<div>By several years the prophecy has lied.</div>
<div>Art so soon wearied of the wealthy place,</div>
<div>For which thou didst not fear to take with guile,</div>
<div>Then ruin the fair Lady?' Now my case</div>
<div>Was like to theirs who linger on, the while</div>
<div>They cannot comprehend what they are told,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And as befooled from further speech resile.</div>
<div>But Virgil bade me: 'Speak out loud and bold,</div>
<div>"I am not he thou thinkest, no, not he!"'</div>
<div>And I made answer as by him controlled.</div>
<div>The spirit's feet then twisted violently,</div>
<div>And, sighing in a voice of deep distress,</div>
<div>He asked: 'What then requirest thou of me?</div>
<div>If me to know thou hast such eagerness,</div>
<div>That thou the cliff hast therefore ventured down,</div>
<div>Know, the Great Mantle sometime was my dress.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>I of the Bear, in sooth, was worthy son:</div>
<div>As once, the Cubs to help, my purse with gain</div>
<div>I stuffed, myself I in this purse have stown.</div>
<div>Stretched out at length beneath my head remain</div>
<div>All the simoniacs that before me went,</div>
<div>And flattened lie throughout the rocky vein.</div>
<div>I in my turn shall also make descent,</div>
<div>Soon as he comes who I believed thou wast,</div>
<div>When I asked quickly what for him was meant.</div>
<div>O'er me with blazing feet more time has past,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>While upside down I fill the topmost room,</div>
<div>Than he his crimsoned feet shall upward cast;</div>
<div>For after him one viler still shall come,</div>
<div>A Pastor from the West, lawless of deed:</div>
<div>To cover both of us his worthy doom.</div>
<div>A modern Jason he, of whom we read</div>
<div>In Maccabees, whose King denied him nought:</div>
<div>With the French King so shall this man succeed.'</div>
<div>Perchance I ventured further than I ought,</div>
<div>But I spake to him in this measure free:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>'Ah, tell me now what money was there sought</div>
<div>Of Peter by our Lord, when either key</div>
<div>He gave him in his guardianship to hold?</div>
<div>Sure He demanded nought save: "Follow me!"</div>
<div>Nor Peter, nor the others, asked for gold</div>
<div>Or silver when upon Matthias fell</div>
<div>The lot instead of him, the traitor-souled.</div>
<div>Keep then thy place, for thou art punished well,</div>
<div>And clutch the pelf, dishonourably gained,</div>
<div>Which against Charles made thee so proudly swell.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And, were it not that I am still restrained</div>
<div>By reverence for those tremendous keys,</div>
<div>Borne by thee while the glad world thee contained,</div>
<div>I would use words even heavier than these;</div>
<div>Seeing your avarice makes the world deplore,</div>
<div>Crushing the good, filling the bad with ease.</div>
<div>'Twas you, O Pastors, the Evangelist bore</div>
<div>In mind what time he saw her on the flood</div>
<div>Of waters set, who played with kings the whore;</div>
<div>Who with seven heads was born; and as she would</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>By the ten horns to her was service done,</div>
<div>Long as her spouse rejoiced in what was good.</div>
<div>Now gold and silver are your god alone:</div>
<div>What difference 'twixt the idolater and you,</div>
<div>Save that ye pray a hundred for his one?</div>
<div>Ah, Constantine, how many evils grew--</div>
<div>Not from thy change of faith, but from the gift</div>
<div>Wherewith thou didst the first rich Pope endue!'</div>
<div>While I my voice continued to uplift</div>
<div>To such a tune, by rage or conscience stirred</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Both of his soles he made to twist and shift.</div>
<div>My Guide, I well believe, with pleasure heard;</div>
<div>Listening he stood with lips so well content</div>
<div>To me propounding truthful word on word.</div>
<div>Then round my body both his arms he bent,</div>
<div>And, having raised me well upon his breast,</div>
<div>Climbed up the path by which he made descent.</div>
<div>Nor was he by his burden so oppressed</div>
<div>But that he bore me to the bridge's crown,</div>
<div>Which with the fourth joins the fifth rampart's crest.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>And lightly here he set his burden down,</div>
<div>Found light by him upon the precipice,</div>
<div>Up which a goat uneasily had gone.</div>
<div>And thence another valley met mine eyes.</div>
<h2>CANTO XX.</h2>
<div>Now of new torment must my verses tell,</div>
<div>And matter for the Twentieth Canto win</div>
<div>Of Lay the First, which treats of souls in Hell.</div>
<div>Already was I eager to begin</div>
<div>To peer into the visible profound,</div>
<div>Which tears of agony was bathed in:</div>
<div>And I saw people in the valley round;</div>
<div>Like that of penitents on earth the pace</div>
<div>At which they weeping came, nor uttering sound.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>When I beheld them with more downcast gaze,</div>
<div>That each was strangely screwed about I learned,</div>
<div>Where chest is joined to chin. And thus the face</div>
<div>Of every one round to his loins was turned;</div>
<div>And stepping backward all were forced to go,</div>
<div>For nought in front could be by them discerned.</div>
<div>Smitten by palsy although one might show</div>
<div>Perhaps a shape thus twisted all awry,</div>
<div>I never saw, and am to think it slow.</div>
<div>As, Reader, God may grant thou profit by</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Thy reading, for thyself consider well</div>
<div>If I could then preserve my visage dry</div>
<div>When close at hand to me was visible</div>
<div>Our human form so wrenched that tears, rained down</div>
<div>Out of the eyes, between the buttocks fell.</div>
<div>In very sooth I wept, leaning upon</div>
<div>A boss of the hard cliff, till on this wise</div>
<div>My Escort asked: 'Of the other fools art one?</div>
<div>Here piety revives as pity dies;</div>
<div>For who more irreligious is than he</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>In whom God's judgments to regret give rise?</div>
<div>Lift up, lift up thy head, and thou shalt see</div>
<div>Him for whom earth yawned as the Thebans saw,</div>
<div>All shouting meanwhile: "Whither dost thou flee,</div>
<div>Amphiaraus? Wherefore thus withdraw</div>
<div>From battle?" But he sinking found no rest</div>
<div>Till Minos clutched him with all-grasping claw.</div>
<div>Lo, how his shoulders serve him for a breast!</div>
<div>Because he wished to see too far before</div>
<div>Backward he looks, to backward course addressed.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Behold Tiresias, who was changed all o'er,</div>
<div>Till for a man a woman met the sight,</div>

<div>The same two twisted serpents with his wand,</div>
<div>Ere he again in manly plumes was dight.</div>
<div>With back to him, see Aruns next at hand,</div>
<div>Who up among the hills of Luni, where</div>
<div>Peasants of near Carrara till the land,</div>

<div>The other one, whose flowing tresses hide</div>

<div>And all whose hair falls on the further side,</div>

<div>Where I was born, at last her foot she stayed.</div>
<div>It likes me well thou shouldst of this be taught.</div>
<div>When from this life her father exit made,</div>

<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>She for long time through many countries strayed.</div>
<div>'Neath mountains by which Germany is walled</div>

<div>Down Pennine; and their flood this lake supplies.</div>

<div>Forming a river, lapse by green degrees.</div>
<div>The river, from its very source, men call</div>
<div>No more Benacus--'tis as Mincio known,</div>
<div>Which into Po does at Governo fall.</div>
<div>A flat it reaches ere it far has run,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Spreading o'er which it feeds a marshy fen,</div>
<div>Whence oft in summer pestilence has grown.</div>
<div>Wayfaring here the cruel virgin, when</div>
<div>She found land girdled by the marshy flood,</div>
<div>Untilled and uninhabited of men,</div>
<div>That she might 'scape all human neighbourhood</div>
<div>Stayed on it with her slaves, her arts to ply;</div>
<div>And there her empty body was bestowed.</div>
<div>On this the people from the country nigh</div>
<div>Into that place came crowding, for the spot,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Girt by the swamp, could all attack defy,</div>
<div>And for the town built o'er her body sought</div>
<div>A name from her who made it first her seat,</div>
<div>Calling it Mantua, without casting lot.</div>
<div>The dwellers in it were in number great,</div>
<div>Till stupid Casalodi was befooled</div>
<div>And victimised by Pinamonte's cheat.</div>
<div>Hence, shouldst thou ever hear (now be thou schooled!)</div>
<div>Another story to my town assigned,</div>
<div>Let by no fraud the truth be overruled.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And I: 'Thy reasonings, Master, to my mind</div>
<div>So cogent are, and win my faith so well,</div>
<div>What others say I shall black embers find.</div>
<div>But of this people passing onward tell,</div>
<div>If thou, of any, something canst declare,</div>
<div>For all my thoughts on that intently dwell.'</div>
<div>And then he said: 'The one whose bearded hair</div>
<div>Falls from his cheeks upon his shoulders dun,</div>
<div>Was, when the land of Greece of males so bare</div>
<div>Was grown the very cradles scarce held one,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>An augur; he with Calchas gave the sign</div>
<div>In Aulis through the first rope knife to run.</div>
<div>Eurypylus was he called, and in some line</div>
<div>Of my high Tragedy is sung the same,</div>
<div>As thou know'st well, who mad'st it wholly thine.</div>
<div>That other, thin of flank, was known to fame</div>
<div>As Michael Scott; and of a verity</div>
<div>He knew right well the black art's inmost game.</div>
<div>Guido Bonatti, and Asdente see</div>
<div>Who mourns he ever should have parted from</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>His thread and leather; but too late mourns he.</div>
<div>Lo the unhappy women who left loom,</div>
<div>Spindle, and needle that they might divine;</div>
<div>With herb and image hastening men's doom.</div>
<div>But come; for where the hemispheres confine</div>
<div>Cain and the Thorns is falling, to alight</div>
<div>Underneath Seville on the ocean line.</div>
<div>The moon was full already yesternight;</div>
<div>Which to recall thou shouldst be well content,</div>
<div>For in the wood she somewhat helped thy plight.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Thus spake he to me while we forward went.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXI.</h2>
<div>Conversing still from bridge to bridge we went;</div>
<div>But what our words I in my Comedy</div>
<div>Care not to tell. The top of the ascent</div>
<div>Holding, we halted the next pit to spy</div>
<div>Of Malebolge, with plaints bootless all:</div>
<div>There, darkness full of wonder met the eye.</div>
<div>As the Venetians in their Arsenal</div>
<div>Boil the tenacious pitch at winter-tide,</div>
<div>To caulk the ships with for repairs that call;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>For then they cannot sail; and so, instead,</div>
<div>One builds his bark afresh, one stops with tow</div>
<div>His vessel's ribs, by many a voyage tried;</div>
<div>One hammers at the poop, one at the prow;</div>
<div>Some fashion oars, and others cables twine,</div>
<div>And others at the jib and main sails sew:</div>
<div>So, not by fire, but by an art Divine,</div>
<div>Pitch of thick substance boiled in that low Hell,</div>
<div>And all the banks did as with plaster line.</div>
<div>I saw it, but distinguished nothing well</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Except the bubbles by the boiling raised,</div>
<div>Now swelling up and ceasing now to swell.</div>
<div>While down upon it fixedly I gazed,</div>
<div>'Beware, beware!' my Leader to me said,</div>
<div>And drew me thence close to him. I, amazed,</div>
<div>Turned sharply round, like him who has delayed,</div>
<div>Fain to behold the thing he ought to flee,</div>
<div>Then, losing nerve, grows suddenly afraid,</div>
<div>Nor lingers longer what there is to see;</div>
<div>For a black devil I beheld advance</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Over the cliff behind us rapidly.</div>
<div>Ah me, how fierce was he of countenance!</div>
<div>What bitterness he in his gesture put,</div>
<div>As with spread wings he o'er the ground did dance!</div>
<div>Upon his shoulders, prominent and acute,</div>
<div>Was perched a sinner fast by either hip;</div>
<div>And him he held by tendon of the foot.</div>
<div>He from our bridge: 'Ho, Malebranche! Grip</div>
<div>An Elder brought from Santa Zita's town:</div>
<div>Stuff him below; myself once more I slip</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Back to the place where lack of such is none.</div>
<div>There, save Bonturo, barrates every man,</div>
<div>And No grows Yes that money may be won.'</div>
<div>He shot him down, and o'er the cliff began</div>
<div>To run; nor unchained mastiff o'er the ground,</div>
<div>Chasing a robber, swifter ever ran.</div>
<div>The other sank, then rose with back bent round;</div>
<div>But from beneath the bridge the devils cried:</div>
<div>'Not here the Sacred Countenance is found,</div>
<div>One swims not here as on the Serchio's tide;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>So if thou wouldst not with our grapplers deal</div>
<div>Do not on surface of the pitch abide.'</div>
<div>Then he a hundred hooks was made to feel.</div>
<div>'Best dance down there,' they said the while to him,</div>
<div>'Where, if thou canst, thou on the sly mayst steal.'</div>
<div>So scullions by the cooks are set to trim</div>
<div>The caldrons and with forks the pieces steep</div>
<div>Down in the water, that they may not swim.</div>
<div>And the good Master said to me: 'Now creep</div>
<div>Behind a rocky splinter for a screen;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>So from their knowledge thou thyself shalt keep.</div>
<div>And fear not thou although with outrage keen</div>
<div>I be opposed, for I am well prepared,</div>
<div>And formerly have in like contest been.'</div>
<div>Then passing from the bridge's crown he fared</div>
<div>To the sixth bank, and when thereon he stood</div>
<div>He needed courage doing what he dared.</div>
<div>In the same furious and tempestuous mood</div>
<div>In which the dogs upon the beggar leap,</div>
<div>Who, halting suddenly, seeks alms or food,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>They issued forth from underneath the deep</div>
<div>Vault of the bridge, with grapplers 'gainst him stretched;</div>
<div>But he exclaimed: 'Aloof, and harmless keep!</div>
<div>Ere I by any of your hooks be touched,</div>
<div>Come one of you and to my words give ear;</div>
<div>And then advise you if I should be clutched.'</div>
<div>All cried: 'Let Malacoda then go near;'</div>
<div>On which one moved, the others standing still.</div>
<div>He coming said: 'What will this help him here?'</div>
<div>'O Malacoda, is it credible</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>That I am come,' my Master then replied,</div>
<div>'Secure your opposition to repel,</div>
<div>Without Heaven's will, and fate, upon my side?</div>
<div>Let me advance, for 'tis by Heaven's behest</div>
<div>That I on this rough road another guide.'</div>
<div>Then was his haughty spirit so depressed,</div>
<div>He let his hook drop sudden to his feet,</div>
<div>And, 'Strike him not!' commanded all the rest</div>
<div>My Leader charged me thus: 'Thou, from thy seat</div>
<div>Where 'mid the bridge's ribs thou crouchest low,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Rejoin me now in confidence complete.'</div>
<div>Whereon I to rejoin him was not slow;</div>
<div>And then the devils, crowding, came so near,</div>
<div>I feared they to their paction false might show.</div>
<div>So at Caprona saw I footmen fear,</div>
<div>Spite of their treaty, when a multitude</div>
<div>Of foes received them, crowding front and rear.</div>
<div>With all my body braced I closer stood</div>
<div>To him, my Leader, and intently eyed</div>
<div>The aspect of them, which was far from good.</div>
<div>Lowering their grapplers, 'mong themselves they cried:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">101</aside>'Shall I now tickle him upon the thigh?'</div>
<div>'Yea, see thou clip him deftly,' one replied.</div>
<div>The demon who in parley had drawn nigh</div>
<div>Unto my Leader, upon this turned round;</div>
<div>'Scarmiglione, lay thy weapon by!'</div>
<div>He said; and then to us: 'No way is found</div>
<div>Further along this cliff, because, undone,</div>
<div>All the sixth arch lies ruined on the ground.</div>
<div>But if it please you further to pass on,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Over this rocky ridge advancing climb</div>
<div>To the next rib, where passage may be won.</div>
<div>Yestreen, but five hours later than this time,</div>
<div>Twelve hundred sixty-six years reached an end,</div>
<div>Since the way lost the wholeness of its prime.</div>
<div>Thither I some of mine will straightway send</div>
<div>To see that none peer forth to breathe the air:</div>
<div>Go on with them; you they will not offend.</div>
<div>You, Alichin and Calcabrin, prepare</div>
<div>To move,' he bade; 'Cagnazzo, thou as well;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Guiding the ten, thou, Barbariccia, fare.</div>
<div>With Draghignazzo, Libicocco fell,</div>
<div>Fanged Ciriatto, Graffiacane too,</div>
<div>Set on, mad Rubicant and Farfarel:</div>
<div>Search on all quarters round the boiling glue.</div>
<div>Let these go safe, till at the bridge they be,</div>
<div>Which doth unbroken o'er the caverns go.'</div>
<div>'Alas, my Master, what is this I see?'</div>
<div>Said I, 'Unguided, let us forward set,</div>
<div>If thou know'st how. I wish no company.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>If former caution thou dost not forget,</div>
<div>Dost thou not mark how each his teeth doth grind,</div>
<div>The while toward us their brows are full of threat?'</div>
<div>And he: 'I would not fear should fill thy mind;</div>
<div>Let them grin all they will, and all they can;</div>
<div>'Tis at the wretches in the pitch confined.'</div>
<div>They wheeled and down the left hand bank began</div>
<div>To march, but first each bit his tongue, and passed</div>
<div>The signal on to him who led the van.</div>
<div>He answered grossly as with trumpet blast.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXII.</h2>
<div>Horsemen I've seen in march across the field,</div>
<div>Hastening to charge, or, answering muster, stand,</div>
<div>And sometimes too when forced their ground to yield;</div>
<div>I have seen skirmishers upon your land,</div>
<div>O Aretines! and those on foray sent;</div>
<div>With trumpet and with bell to sound command</div>
<div>Have seen jousts run and well-fought tournament,</div>
<div>With drum, and signal from the castle shown,</div>
<div>And foreign music with familiar blent;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>But ne'er by blast on such a trumpet blown</div>
<div>Beheld I horse or foot to motion brought,</div>
<div>Nor ship by star or landmark guided on.</div>
<div>With the ten demons moved we from the spot;</div>
<div>Ah, cruel company! but 'with the good</div>
<div>In church, and in the tavern with the sot.'</div>
<div>Still to the pitch was my attention glued</div>
<div>Fully to see what in the Bolgia lay,</div>
<div>And who were in its burning mass imbrued.</div>
<div>As when the dolphins vaulted backs display,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Warning to mariners they should prepare</div>
<div>To trim their vessel ere the storm makes way;</div>
<div>So, to assuage the pain he had to bear,</div>
<div>Some wretch would show his back above the tide,</div>
<div>Then swifter plunge than lightnings cleave the air.</div>
<div>And as the frogs close to the marsh's side</div>
<div>With muzzles thrust out of the water stand,</div>
<div>While feet and bodies carefully they hide;</div>
<div>So stood the sinners upon every hand.</div>
<div>But on beholding Barbariccia nigh</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Beneath the bubbles disappeared the band.</div>
<div>I saw what still my heart is shaken by:</div>
<div>One waiting, as it sometimes comes to pass</div>
<div>That one frog plunges, one at rest doth lie;</div>
<div>And Graffiacan, who nearest to him was,</div>
<div>Him upward drew, clutching his pitchy hair:</div>
<div>To me he bore the look an otter has.</div>
<div>I of their names ere this was well aware,</div>
<div>For I gave heed unto the names of all</div>
<div>When they at first were chosen. 'Now prepare,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And, Rubicante, with thy talons fall</div>
<div>Upon him and flay well,' with many cries</div>
<div>And one consent the accursed ones did call.</div>
<div>I said: 'O Master, if in any wise</div>
<div>Thou canst, find out who is the wretched wight</div>
<div>Thus at the mercy of his enemies.'</div>
<div>Whereon my Guide drew full within his sight,</div>
<div>Asking him whence he came, and he replied:</div>
<div>'In kingdom of Navarre I first saw light.</div>
<div>Me servant to a lord my mother tied;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Through her I from a scoundrel sire did spring,</div>
<div>Waster of goods and of himself beside.</div>
<div>As servant next to Thiebault, righteous king,</div>
<div>I set myself to ply barratorship;</div>
<div>And in this heat discharge my reckoning.'</div>
<div>And Ciriatto, close upon whose lip</div>
<div>On either side a boar-like tusk did stand,</div>
<div>Made him to feel how one of them could rip.</div>
<div>The mouse had stumbled on the wild cat band;</div>
<div>But Barbariccia locked him in embrace,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And, 'Off while I shall hug him!' gave command.</div>
<div>Round to my Master then he turned his face:</div>
<div>'Ask more of him if more thou wouldest know,</div>
<div>While he against their fury yet finds grace.'</div>
<div>My Leader asked: 'Declare now if below</div>
<div>The pitch 'mong all the guilty there lies here</div>
<div>A Latian?' He replied: 'Short while ago</div>
<div>From one I parted who to them lived near;</div>
<div>And would that I might use him still for shield,</div>
<div>Then hook or claw I should no longer fear,'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Said Libicocco: 'Too much grace we yield.'</div>
<div>And in the sinner's arm he fixed his hook,</div>
<div>And from it clean a fleshy fragment peeled.</div>
<div>But seeing Draghignazzo also took</div>
<div>Aim at his legs, the leader of the Ten</div>
<div>Turned swiftly round on them with angry look.</div>
<div>On this they were a little quieted; then</div>
<div>Of him who still gazed on his wound my Guide</div>
<div>Without delay demanded thus again:</div>
<div>'Who was it whom, in coming to the side,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Thou say'st thou didst do ill to leave behind?'</div>
<div>'Gomita of Gallura,' he replied,</div>
<div>'A vessel full of fraud of every kind,</div>
<div>Who, holding in his power his master's foes,</div>
<div>So used them him they bear in thankful mind;</div>
<div>For, taking bribes, he let slip all of those,</div>
<div>He says; and he in other posts did worse,</div>
<div>And as a chieftain 'mong barrators rose.</div>
<div>Don Michael Zanche doth with him converse,</div>
<div>From Logodoro, and with endless din</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>They gossip of Sardinian characters.</div>
<div>But look, ah me! how yonder one doth grin.</div>
<div>More would I say, but that I am afraid</div>
<div>He is about to claw me on the skin.'</div>
<div>To Farfarel the captain turned his head,</div>
<div>For, as about to swoop, he rolled his eye,</div>
<div>And, 'Cursed hawk, preserve thy distance!' said.</div>
<div>'If ye would talk with, or would closer spy,'</div>
<div>The frighted wretch began once more to say,</div>
<div>'Tuscans or Lombards, I will bring them nigh.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>But let the Malebranche first give way,</div>
<div>That of their vengeance they may not have fear,</div>
<div>And I to this same place where now I stay</div>
<div>For me, who am but one, will bring seven near</div>
<div>When I shall whistle as we use to do</div>
<div>Whenever on the surface we appear.'</div>
<div>On this Cagnazzo up his muzzle threw,</div>
<div>Shaking his head and saying: 'Hear the cheat</div>
<div>He has contrived, to throw himself below.'</div>
<div>Then he who in devices was complete:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>'Far too malicious, in good sooth,' replied,</div>
<div>'When for my friends I plan a sorer fate.'</div>
<div>This, Alichin withstood not but denied</div>
<div>The others' counsel, saying: 'If thou fling</div>
<div>Thyself hence, thee I strive not to outstride.</div>
<div>But o'er the pitch I'll dart upon the wing.</div>
<div>Leave we the ridge, and be the bank a shield;</div>
<div>And see if thou canst all of us outspring.'</div>
<div>O Reader, hear a novel trick revealed.</div>
<div>All to the other side turned round their eyes,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>He first who slowest was the boon to yield.</div>
<div>In choice of time the Navarrese was wise;</div>
<div>Taking firm stand, himself he forward flung,</div>
<div>Eluding thus their hostile purposes.</div>
<div>Then with compunction each of them was stung,</div>
<div>But he the most whose slackness made them fail;</div>
<div>Therefore he started, 'Caught!' upon his tongue.</div>
<div>But little it bested, nor could prevail</div>
<div>His wings 'gainst fear. Below the other went,</div>
<div>While he with upturned breast aloft did sail.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>And as the falcon, when, on its descent,</div>
<div>The wild duck suddenly dives out of sight,</div>
<div>Returns outwitted back, and malcontent;</div>
<div>To be befooled filled Calcabrin with spite.</div>
<div>Hovering he followed, wishing in his mind</div>
<div>The wretch escaping should leave cause for fight.</div>
<div>When the barrator vanished, from behind</div>
<div>He on his comrade with his talons fell</div>
<div>And clawed him, 'bove the moat with him entwined.</div>
<div>The other was a spar-hawk terrible</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>To claw in turn; together then the two</div>
<div>Plunged in the boiling pool. The heat full well</div>
<div>How to unlock their fierce embraces knew;</div>
<div>But yet they had no power to rise again,</div>
<div>So were their wings all plastered o'er with glue.</div>
<div>Then Barbariccia, mourning with his train,</div>
<div>Caused four to fly forth to the other side</div>
<div>With all their grapplers. Swift their flight was ta'en.</div>
<div>Down to the place from either hand they glide,</div>
<div>Reaching their hooks to those who were limed fast,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>And now beneath the scum were being fried.</div>
<div>And from them thus engaged we onward passed.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXIII.</h2>
<div>Silent, alone, not now with company</div>
<div>We onward went, one first and one behind,</div>
<div>As Minor Friars use to make their way.</div>
<div>On Aesop's fable wholly was my mind</div>
<div>Intent, by reason of that contest new--</div>
<div>The fable where the frog and mouse we find;</div>
<div>For Mo and Issa are not more of hue</div>
<div>Than like the fable shall the fact appear,</div>
<div>If but considered with attention due.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>And as from one thought springs the next, so here</div>
<div>Out of my first arose another thought,</div>
<div>Until within me doubled was my fear.</div>
<div>For thus I judged: Seeing through us were brought</div>
<div>Contempt upon them, hurt, and sore despite,</div>
<div>They needs must be to deep vexation wrought.</div>
<div>If anger to malevolence unite,</div>
<div>Then will they us more cruelly pursue</div>
<div>Than dog the hare which almost feels its bite.</div>
<div>All my hair bristled, I already knew,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>With terror when I spake: 'O Master, try</div>
<div>To hide us quick' (and back I turned to view</div>
<div>What lay behind), 'for me they terrify,</div>
<div>These Malebranche following us; from dread</div>
<div>I almost fancy I can feel them nigh.'</div>
<div>And he: 'Were I a mirror backed with lead</div>
<div>I should no truer glass that form of thine,</div>
<div>Than all thy thought by mine is answered.</div>
<div>For even now thy thoughts accord with mine,</div>
<div>Alike in drift and featured with one face;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>And to suggest one counsel they combine.</div>
<div>If the right bank slope downward at this place,</div>
<div>To the next Bolgia offering us a way,</div>
<div>Swiftly shall we evade the imagined chase.'</div>
<div>Ere he completely could his purpose say,</div>
<div>I saw them with their wings extended wide,</div>
<div>Close on us; as of us to make their prey.</div>
<div>Then quickly was I snatched up by my Guide:</div>
<div>Even as a mother when, awaked by cries,</div>
<div>She sees the flames are kindling at her side,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Delaying not, seizes her child and flies;</div>
<div>Careful for him her proper danger mocks,</div>
<div>Nor even with one poor shift herself supplies.</div>
<div>And he, stretched out upon the flinty rocks,</div>
<div>Himself unto the precipice resigned</div>
<div>Which one side of the other Bolgia blocks.</div>
<div>A swifter course ne'er held a stream confined,</div>
<div>That it may turn a mill, within its race,</div>
<div>Where near the buckets 'tis the most declined</div>
<div>Than was my Master's down that rock's sheer face;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Nor seemed I then his comrade, as we sped,</div>
<div>But like a son locked in a sire's embrace.</div>
<div>And barely had his feet struck on the bed</div>
<div>Of the low ground, when they were seen to stand</div>
<div>Upon the crest, no more a cause of dread.</div>
<div>For Providence supreme, who so had planned</div>
<div>In the Fifth Bolgia they should minister,</div>
<div>Them wholly from departure thence had banned.</div>
<div>'Neath us we saw a painted people fare,</div>
<div>Weeping as on their way they circled slow,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Crushed by fatigue to look at, and despair.</div>
<div>Cloaks had they on with hoods pulled down full low</div>
<div>Upon their eyes, and fashioned, as it seemed,</div>
<div>Like those which at Cologne for monks they sew.</div>
<div>The outer face was gilt so that it gleamed;</div>
<div>Inside was all of lead, of such a weight</div>
<div>Frederick's to these had been but straw esteemed.</div>
<div>O weary robes for an eternal state!</div>
<div>With them we turned to the left hand once more,</div>
<div>Intent upon their tears disconsolate.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>But those folk, wearied with the loads they bore,</div>
<div>So slowly crept that still new company</div>
<div>Was ours at every footfall on the floor.</div>
<div>Whence to my Guide I said: 'Do thou now try</div>
<div>To find some one by name or action known,</div>
<div>And as we go on all sides turn thine eye.'</div>
<div>And one, who recognised the Tuscan tone,</div>
<div>Called from behind us: 'Halt, I you entreat</div>
<div>Who through the air obscure are hastening on;</div>
<div>Haply in me thou what thou seek'st shalt meet.'</div>
<div>Whereon my Guide turned round and said: 'Await,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">81</aside>And keep thou time with pacing of his feet.'</div>
<div>I stood, and saw two manifesting great</div>
<div>Desire to join me, by their countenance;</div>
<div>But their loads hampered them and passage strait.</div>
<div>And, when arrived, me with an eye askance</div>
<div>They gazed on long time, but no word they spoke;</div>
<div>Then, to each other turned, held thus parlance:</div>
<div>'His heaving throat proves him of living folk.</div>
<div>If they are of the dead, how could they gain</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>To walk uncovered by the heavy cloak?'</div>
<div>Then to me: 'Tuscan, who dost now attain</div>
<div>To the college of the hypocrites forlorn,</div>
<div>To tell us who thou art show no disdain.'</div>
<div>And I to them: 'I was both bred and born</div>
<div>In the great city by fair Arno's stream,</div>
<div>And wear the body I have always worn.</div>
<div>But who are ye, whose suffering supreme</div>
<div>Makes tears, as I behold, to flood the cheek;</div>
<div>And what your mode of pain that thus doth gleam?'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>'Ah me, the yellow mantles,' one to speak</div>
<div>Began, 'are all of lead so thick, its weight</div>
<div>Maketh the scales after this manner creak.</div>
<div>We, Merry Friars of Bologna's state,</div>
<div>I Catalano, Loderingo he,</div>
<div>Were by thy town together designate,</div>
<div>As for the most part one is used to be,</div>
<div>To keep the peace within it; and around</div>
<div>Gardingo, what we were men still may see.'</div>
<div>I made beginning: 'Friars, your profound--'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>But said no more, on suddenly seeing there</div>
<div>One crucified by three stakes to the ground,</div>
<div>Who, when he saw me, writhed as in despair,</div>
<div>Breathing into his beard with heavy sigh.</div>
<div>And Friar Catalan, of this aware,</div>
<div>Said: 'He thus fixed, on whom thou turn'st thine eye,</div>
<div>Counselled the Pharisees that it behoved</div>
<div>One man as victim for the folk should die.</div>
<div>Naked, thou seest, he lies, and ne'er removed</div>
<div>From where, set 'cross the path, by him the weight</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Of every one that passes by is proved.</div>
<div>And his wife's father shares an equal fate,</div>
<div>With others of the Council, in this fosse;</div>
<div>For to the Jews they proved seed reprobate.'</div>
<div>Meanwhile at him thus stretched upon the cross</div>
<div>Virgil, I saw, displayed astonishment--</div>
<div>At his mean exile and eternal loss.</div>
<div>And then this question to the Friars he sent:</div>
<div>'Be not displeased, but, if ye may, avow</div>
<div>If on the right hand there lies any vent</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>By which we, both of us, from hence may go,</div>
<div>Nor need the black angelic company</div>
<div>To come to help us from this valley low.'</div>
<div>'Nearer than what thou think'st,' he made reply,</div>
<div>'A rib there runs from the encircling wall,</div>
<div>The cruel vales in turn o'erarching high;</div>
<div>Save that at this 'tis rent and ruined all.</div>
<div>Ye can climb upward o'er the shattered heap</div>
<div>Where down the side the piled-up fragments fall.'</div>
<div>His head bent down a while my Guide did keep,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Then said: 'He warned us in imperfect wise,</div>
<div>Who sinners with his hook doth clutch and steep.'</div>
<div>The Friar: 'At Bologna many a vice</div>
<div>I heard the Devil charged with, and among</div>
<div>The rest that, false, he father is of lies.'</div>
<div>Then onward moved my Guide with paces long,</div>
<div>And some slight shade of anger on his face.</div>
<div>I with him parted from the burdened throng,</div>
<div>Stepping where those dear feet had left their trace.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXIV.</h2>
<div>In season of the new year, when the sun</div>
<div>Beneath Aquarius warms again his hair,</div>
<div>And somewhat on the nights the days have won;</div>
<div>When on the ground the hoar-frost painteth fair</div>
<div>A mimic image of her sister white--</div>
<div>But soon her brush of colour is all bare--</div>
<div>The clown, whose fodder is consumed outright,</div>
<div>Rises and looks abroad, and, all the plain</div>
<div>Beholding glisten, on his thigh doth smite.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Returned indoors, like wretch that seeks in vain</div>
<div>What he should do, restless he mourns his case;</div>
<div>But hope revives when, looking forth again,</div>
<div>He sees the earth anew has changed its face.</div>
<div>Then with his crook he doth himself provide,</div>
<div>And straightway doth his sheep to pasture chase:</div>
<div>So at my Master was I terrified,</div>
<div>His brows beholding troubled; nor more slow</div>
<div>To where I ailed the plaster was applied.</div>
<div>For when the broken bridge we stood below</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>My Guide turned to me with the expression sweet</div>
<div>Which I beneath the mountain learned to know.</div>
<div>His arms he opened, after counsel meet</div>
<div>Held with himself, and, scanning closely o'er</div>
<div>The fragments first, he raised me from my feet;</div>
<div>And like a man who, working, looks before,</div>
<div>With foresight still on that in front bestowed,</div>
<div>Me to the summit of a block he bore</div>
<div>And then to me another fragment showed,</div>
<div>Saying: 'By this thou now must clamber on;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>But try it first if it will bear thy load.'</div>
<div>The heavy cowled this way could ne'er have gone,</div>
<div>For hardly we, I holpen, he so light,</div>
<div>Could clamber up from shattered stone to stone.</div>
<div>And but that on the inner bank the height</div>
<div>Of wall is not so great, I say not he,</div>
<div>But for myself I had been vanquished quite.</div>
<div>But Malebolge to the cavity</div>
<div>Of the deep central pit is planned to fall;</div>
<div>Hence every Bolgia in its turn must be</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>High on the out, low on the inner wall;</div>
<div>So to the summit we attained at last,</div>
<div>Whence breaks away the topmost stone of all.</div>
<div>My lungs were so with breathlessness harassed,</div>
<div>The summit won, I could no further go;</div>
<div>And, hardly there, me on the ground I cast</div>
<div>'Well it befits that thou shouldst from thee throw</div>
<div>All sloth,' the Master said; 'for stretched in down</div>
<div>Or under awnings none can glory know.</div>
<div>And he who spends his life nor wins renown</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Leaves in the world no more enduring trace</div>
<div>Than smoke in air, or foam on water blown.</div>
<div>Therefore arise; o'ercome thy breathlessness</div>
<div>By force of will, victor in every fight</div>
<div>When not subservient to the body base.</div>
<div>Of stairs thou yet must climb a loftier flight:</div>
<div>'Tis not enough to have ascended these.</div>
<div>Up then and profit if thou hear'st aright.'</div>
<div>Rising I feigned to breathe with greater ease</div>
<div>Than what I felt, and spake: 'Now forward plod,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>For with my courage now my strength agrees.'</div>
<div>Up o'er the rocky rib we held our road;</div>
<div>And rough it was and difficult and strait,</div>
<div>And steeper far than that we earlier trod.</div>
<div>Speaking I went, to hide my wearied state,</div>
<div>When from the neighbouring moat a voice we heard</div>
<div>Which seemed ill fitted to articulate.</div>
<div>Of what it said I knew not any word,</div>
<div>Though on the arch that vaults the moat set high;</div>
<div>But he who spake appeared by anger stirred.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Though I bent downward yet my eager eye,</div>
<div>So dim the depth, explored it all in vain;</div>
<div>I then: 'O Master, to that bank draw nigh,</div>
<div>And let us by the wall descent obtain,</div>
<div>Because I hear and do not understand,</div>
<div>And looking down distinguish nothing plain.'</div>
<div>'My sole reply to thee,' he answered bland,</div>
<div>'Is to perform; for it behoves,' he said,</div>
<div>'With silent act to answer just demand.'</div>
<div>Then we descended from the bridge's head,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Where with the eighth bank is its junction wrought;</div>
<div>And full beneath me was the Bolgia spread.</div>
<div>And I perceived that hideously 'twas fraught</div>
<div>With serpents; and such monstrous forms they bore,</div>
<div>Even now my blood is curdled at the thought.</div>
<div>Henceforth let sandy Libya boast no more!</div>
<div>Though she breed hydra, snake that crawls or flies,</div>
<div>Twy-headed, or fine-speckled, no such store</div>
<div>Of plagues, nor near so cruel, she supplies,</div>
<div>Though joined to all the land of Ethiop,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>And that which by the Red Sea waters lies.</div>
<div>'Midst this fell throng and dismal, without hope</div>
<div>A naked people ran, aghast with fear--</div>
<div>No covert for them and no heliotrope.</div>
<div>Their hands were bound by serpents at their rear,</div>
<div>Which in their reins for head and tail did get</div>
<div>A holding-place: in front they knotted were.</div>
<div>And lo! to one who on our side was set</div>
<div>A serpent darted forward, him to bite</div>
<div>At where the neck is by the shoulders met.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Nor O nor I did any ever write</div>
<div>More quickly than he kindled, burst in flame,</div>
<div>And crumbled all to ashes. And when quite</div>
<div>He on the earth a wasted heap became,</div>
<div>The ashes of themselves together rolled,</div>
<div>Resuming suddenly their former frame.</div>
<div>Thus, as by mighty sages we are told,</div>
<div>The Phoenix dies, and then is born again,</div>
<div>When it is close upon five centuries old.</div>
<div>In all its life it eats not herb nor grain,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>But only tears that from frankincense flow;</div>
<div>It, for a shroud, sweet nard and myrrh contain.</div>
<div>And as the man who falls and knows not how,</div>
<div>By force of demons stretched upon the ground,</div>
<div>Or by obstruction that makes life run low,</div>
<div>When risen up straight gazes all around</div>
<div>In deep confusion through the anguish keen</div>
<div>He suffered from, and stares with sighs profound:</div>
<div>So was the sinner, when arisen, seen.</div>
<div>Justice of God, how are thy terrors piled,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Showering in vengeance blows thus big with teen!</div>
<div>My Guide then asked of him how he was styled.</div>
<div>Whereon he said: 'From Tuscany I rained,</div>
<div>Not long ago, into this gullet wild.</div>
<div>From bestial life, not human, joy I gained,</div>
<div>Mule that I was; me, Vanni Fucci, brute,</div>
<div>Pistoia, fitting den, in life contained.'</div>
<div>I to my Guide: 'Bid him not budge a foot,</div>
<div>And ask what crime has plunged him here below.</div>
<div>In rage and blood I knew him dissolute.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>The sinner heard, nor insincere did show,</div>
<div>But towards me turned his face and eke his mind,</div>
<div>With spiteful shame his features all aglow;</div>
<div>Then said: 'It pains me more thou shouldst me find</div>
<div>And catch me steeped in all this misery,</div>
<div>Than when the other life I left behind.</div>
<div>What thou demandest I can not deny:</div>
<div>I'm plunged thus low because the thief I played</div>
<div>Within the fairly furnished sacristy;</div>
<div>And falsely to another's charge 'twas laid.</div>
<div>Lest thou shouldst joy such sight has met thy view</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">141</aside>If e'er these dreary regions thou evade,</div>
<div>Give ear and hearken to my utterance true:</div>
<div>The Neri first out of Pistoia fail,</div>
<div>Her laws and parties Florence shapes anew;</div>
<div>Mars draws a vapour out of Magra's vale,</div>
<div>Which black and threatening clouds accompany:</div>
<div>Then bursting in a tempest terrible</div>
<div>Upon Piceno shall the war run high;</div>
<div>The mist by it shall suddenly be rent,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>And every Bianco smitten be thereby:</div>
<div>And I have told thee that thou mayst lament.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XXV.</h2>
<div>The robber, when his words were ended so,</div>
<div>Made both the figs and lifted either fist,</div>
<div>Shouting: 'There, God! for them at thee I throw.'</div>
<div>Then were the snakes my friends; for one 'gan twist</div>
<div>And coiled itself around the sinner's throat,</div>
<div>As if to say: 'Now would I have thee whist.'</div>
<div>Another seized his arms and made a knot,</div>
<div>Clinching itself upon them in such wise</div>
<div>He had no power to move them by a jot.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Pistoia! thou, Pistoia, shouldst devise</div>
<div>To burn thyself to ashes, since thou hast</div>
<div>Outrun thy founders in iniquities.</div>
<div>The blackest depths of Hell through which I passed</div>
<div>Showed me no soul 'gainst God so filled with spite,</div>
<div>No, not even he who down Thebes' wall was cast.</div>
<div>He spake no further word, but turned to flight;</div>
<div>And I beheld a Centaur raging sore</div>
<div>Come shouting: 'Of the ribald give me sight!'</div>
<div>I scarce believe Maremma yieldeth more</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Snakes of all kinds than what composed the load</div>
<div>Which on his back, far as our form, he bore.</div>
<div>Behind his nape, with pinions spread abroad,</div>
<div>A dragon couchant on his shoulders lay</div>
<div>To set on fire whoever bars his road.</div>
<div>'This one is Cacus,' did my Master say,</div>
<div>'Who underneath the rock of Aventine</div>
<div>Watered a pool with blood day after day.</div>
<div>Not with his brethren runs he in the line,</div>
<div>Because of yore the treacherous theft he wrought</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Upon the neighbouring wealthy herd of kine:</div>
<div>Whence to his crooked course an end was brought</div>
<div>'Neath Hercules' club, which on him might shower down</div>
<div>A hundred blows; ere ten he suffered nought.'</div>
<div>While this he said, the other had passed on;</div>
<div>And under us three spirits forward pressed</div>
<div>Of whom my Guide and I had nothing known</div>
<div>But that: 'Who are ye?' they made loud request.</div>
<div>Whereon our tale no further could proceed;</div>
<div>And toward them wholly we our wits addressed.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>I recognised them not, but gave good heed;</div>
<div>Till, as it often haps in such a case,</div>
<div>To name another, one discovered need,</div>
<div>Saying: 'Now where stopped Cianfa in the race?'</div>
<div>Then, that my Guide might halt and hearken well,</div>
<div>On chin and nose I did my finger place.</div>
<div>If, Reader, to believe what now I tell</div>
<div>Thou shouldst be slow, I wonder not, for I</div>
<div>Who saw it all scarce find it credible.</div>
<div>While I on them my brows kept lifted high</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>A serpent, which had six feet, suddenly flew</div>
<div>At one of them and held him bodily.</div>
<div>Its middle feet about his paunch it drew,</div>
<div>And with the two in front his arms clutched fast,</div>
<div>And bit one cheek and the other through and through.</div>
<div>Its hinder feet upon his thighs it cast,</div>
<div>Thrusting its tail between them till behind,</div>
<div>Distended o'er his reins, it upward passed.</div>
<div>The ivy to a tree could never bind</div>
<div>Itself so firmly as this dreadful beast</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Its members with the other's intertwined.</div>
<div>Each lost the colour that it once possessed,</div>
<div>And closely they, like heated wax, unite,</div>
<div>The former hue of neither manifest:</div>
<div>Even so up o'er papyrus, when alight,</div>
<div>Before the flame there spreads a colour dun,</div>
<div>Not black as yet, though from it dies the white.</div>
<div>The other two meanwhile were looking on,</div>
<div>Crying: 'Agnello, how art thou made new!</div>
<div>Thou art not twain, and yet no longer one.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>A single head was moulded out of two;</div>
<div>And on our sight a single face arose,</div>
<div>Which out of both lost countenances grew.</div>
<div>Four separate limbs did but two arms compose;</div>
<div>Belly with chest, and legs with thighs did grow</div>
<div>To members such as nought created shows.</div>
<div>Their former fashion was all perished now:</div>
<div>The perverse shape did both, yet neither seem;</div>
<div>And, thus transformed, departed moving slow.</div>
<div>And as the lizard, which at fierce extreme</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Of dog-day heat another hedge would gain,</div>
<div>Flits 'cross the path swift as the lightning's gleam;</div>
<div>Right for the bellies of the other twain</div>
<div>A little snake quivering with anger sped,</div>
<div>Livid and black as is a pepper grain,</div>
<div>And on the part by which we first are fed</div>
<div>Pierced one of them; and then upon the ground</div>
<div>It fell before him, and remained outspread.</div>
<div>The wounded gazed on it, but made no sound.</div>
<div>Rooted he stood and yawning, scarce awake,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>As seized by fever or by sleep profound.</div>
<div>It closely watched him and he watched the snake,</div>
<div>While from its mouth and from his wound 'gan swell</div>
<div>Volumes of smoke which joined one cloud to make.</div>
<div>Be Lucan henceforth dumb, nor longer tell</div>
<div>Of plagued Sabellus and Nassidius,</div>
<div>But, hearkening to what follows, mark it well.</div>
<div>Silent be Ovid: of him telling us</div>
<div>How Cadmus to a snake, and to a fount</div>
<div>Changed Arethuse, I am not envious;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>For never of two natures front to front</div>
<div>In metamorphosis, while mutually</div>
<div>The forms their matter changed, he gives account.</div>
<div>'Twas thus that each to the other made reply:</div>
<div>Its tail into a fork the serpent split;</div>
<div>Bracing his feet the other pulled them nigh:</div>
<div>And then in one so thoroughly were knit</div>
<div>His legs and thighs, no searching could divine</div>
<div>At where the junction had been wrought in it.</div>
<div>The shape, of which the one lost every sign,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>The cloven tail was taking; then the skin</div>
<div>Of one grew rough, the other's soft and fine.</div>
<div>I by the armpits saw the arms drawn in;</div>
<div>And now the monster's feet, which had been small,</div>
<div>What the other's lost in length appeared to win.</div>
<div>Together twisted, its hind feet did fall</div>
<div>And grew the member men are used to hide:</div>
<div>For his the wretch gained feet with which to crawl.</div>
<div>Dyed in the smoke they took on either side</div>
<div>A novel colour: hair unwonted grew</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>On one; the hair upon the other died.</div>
<div>The one fell prone, erect the other drew,</div>
<div>With cruel eyes continuing to glare,</div>
<div>'Neath which their muzzles metamorphose knew.</div>
<div>The erect to his brows drew his. Of stuff to spare</div>
<div>Of what he upward pulled, there was no lack;</div>
<div>So ears were formed on cheeks that erst were bare.</div>
<div>Of that which clung in front nor was drawn back,</div>
<div>Superfluous, on the face was formed a nose,</div>
<div>And lips absorbed the skin that still was slack.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>His muzzle who lay prone now forward goes;</div>
<div>Backward into his head his ears he draws</div>
<div>Even as a snail appears its horns to lose.</div>
<div>The tongue, which had been whole and ready was</div>
<div>For speech, cleaves now; the forked tongue of the snake</div>
<div>Joins in the other: and the smoke has pause.</div>
<div>The soul which thus a brutish form did take,</div>
<div>Along the valley, hissing, swiftly fled;</div>
<div>The other close behind it spluttering spake,</div>
<div>Then, toward it turning his new shoulders, said</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Unto the third: 'Now Buoso down the way</div>
<div>May hasten crawling, as I earlier sped.'</div>
<div>Ballast which in the Seventh Bolgia lay</div>
<div>Thus saw I shift and change. Be my excuse</div>
<div>The novel theme, if swerves my pen astray.</div>
<div>And though these things mine eyesight might confuse</div>
<div>A little, and my mind with fear divide,</div>
<div>Such secrecy they fleeing could not use</div>
<div>But that Puccio Sciancatto plain I spied;</div>
<div>And he alone of the companions three</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>Who came at first, was left unmodified.</div>
<div>For the other, tears, Gaville, are shed by thee.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXVI.</h2>
<div>Rejoice, O Florence, in thy widening fame!</div>
<div>Thy wings thou beatest over land and sea,</div>
<div>And even through Inferno spreads thy name.</div>
<div>Burghers of thine, five such were found by me</div>
<div>Among the thieves; whence I ashamed grew,</div>
<div>Nor shall great glory thence redound to thee.</div>
<div>But if 'tis toward the morning dreams are true,</div>
<div>Thou shalt experience ere long time be gone</div>
<div>The doom even Prato prays for as thy due.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>And came it now, it would not come too soon.</div>
<div>Would it were come as come it must with time:</div>
<div>'Twill crush me more the older I am grown.</div>
<div>Departing thence, my Guide began to climb</div>
<div>The jutting rocks by which we made descent</div>
<div>Some while ago, and pulled me after him.</div>
<div>And as upon our lonely way we went</div>
<div>'Mong splinters of the cliff, the feet in vain,</div>
<div>Without the hand to help, had labour spent.</div>
<div>I sorrowed, and am sorrow-smit again,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Recalling what before mine eyes there lay,</div>
<div>And, more than I am wont, my genius rein</div>
<div>From running save where virtue leads the way;</div>
<div>So that if happy star or holier might</div>
<div>Have gifted me I never mourn it may.</div>
<div>At time of year when he who gives earth light</div>
<div>His face shows to us longest visible,</div>
<div>When gnats replace the fly at fall of night,</div>
<div>Not by the peasant resting on the hill</div>
<div>Are seen more fire-flies in the vale below,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Where he perchance doth field and vineyard till,</div>
<div>Than flamelets I beheld resplendent glow</div>
<div>Throughout the whole Eighth Bolgia, when at last</div>
<div>I stood whence I the bottom plain could know.</div>
<div>And as he whom the bears avenged, when passed</div>
<div>From the earth Elijah, saw the chariot rise</div>
<div>With horses heavenward reared and mounting fast,</div>
<div>And no long time had traced it with his eyes</div>
<div>Till but a flash of light it all became,</div>
<div>Which like a rack of cloud swept to the skies:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Deep in the valley's gorge, in mode the same,</div>
<div>These flitted; what it held by none was shown,</div>
<div>And yet a sinner lurked in every flame.</div>
<div>To see them well I from the bridge peered down,</div>
<div>And if a jutting crag I had not caught</div>
<div>I must have fallen, though neither thrust nor thrown.</div>
<div>My Leader me beholding lost in thought:</div>
<div>'In all the fires are spirits,' said to me;</div>
<div>'His flame round each is for a garment wrought.'</div>
<div>'O Master!' I replied, 'by hearing thee</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>I grow assured, but yet I knew before</div>
<div>That thus indeed it was, and longed to be</div>
<div>Told who is in the flame which there doth soar,</div>
<div>Cloven, as if ascending from the pyre</div>
<div>Where with Eteocles there burned of yore</div>
<div>His brother.' He: 'Ulysses in that fire</div>
<div>And Diomedes burn; in punishment</div>
<div>Thus held together, as they held in ire.</div>
<div>And, wrapped within their flame, they now repent</div>
<div>The ambush of the horse, which oped the door</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Through which the Romans' noble seed forth went.</div>
<div>For guile Deidamia makes deplore</div>
<div>In death her lost Achilles, tears they shed,</div>
<div>And bear for the Palladium vengeance sore.'</div>
<div>'Master, I pray thee fervently,' I said,</div>
<div>'If from those flames they still can utter speech--</div>
<div>Give ear as if a thousand times I pled!</div>
<div>Refuse not here to linger, I beseech,</div>
<div>Until the cloven fire shall hither gain:</div>
<div>Thou seest how toward it eagerly I reach.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And he: 'Thy prayers are worthy to obtain</div>
<div>Exceeding praise; thou hast what thou dost seek:</div>
<div>But see that thou from speech thy tongue refrain.</div>
<div>I know what thou wouldst have; leave me to speak,</div>
<div>For they perchance would hear contemptuously</div>
<div>Shouldst thou address them, seeing they were Greek.'</div>
<div>Soon as the flame toward us had come so nigh</div>
<div>That to my Leader time and place seemed met,</div>
<div>I heard him thus adjure it to reply:</div>
<div>'O ye who twain within one fire are set,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>If what I did your guerdon meriteth,</div>
<div>If much or little ye are in my debt</div>
<div>For the great verse I built while I had breath,</div>
<div>By one of you be openly confessed</div>
<div>Where, lost to men, at last he met with death.'</div>
<div>Of the ancient flame the more conspicuous crest</div>
<div>Murmuring began to waver up and down</div>
<div>Like flame that flickers, by the wind distressed.</div>
<div>At length by it was measured motion shown,</div>
<div>Like tongue that moves in speech; and by the flame</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Was language uttered thus: 'When I had gone</div>
<div>From Circe who a long year kept me tame</div>
<div>Beside her, ere the near Gaeta had</div>
<div>Received from Aeneas that new name;</div>
<div>No softness for my son, nor reverence sad</div>
<div>For my old father, nor the love I owed</div>
<div>Penelope with which to make her glad,</div>
<div>Could quench the ardour that within me glowed</div>
<div>A full experience of the world to gain--</div>
<div>Of human vice and worth. But I abroad</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Launched out upon the high and open main</div>
<div>With but one bark and but the little band</div>
<div>Which ne'er deserted me. As far as Spain</div>
<div>I saw the sea-shore upon either hand,</div>
<div>And as Morocco; saw Sardinia's isle,</div>
<div>And all of which those waters wash the strand.</div>
<div>I and my comrades were grown old the while</div>
<div>And sluggish, ere we to the narrows came</div>
<div>Where Hercules of old did landmarks pile</div>
<div>For sign to men they should no further aim;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>And Seville lay behind me on the right,</div>
<div>As on the left lay Ceuta. Then to them</div>
<div>I spake: "O Brothers, who through such a fight</div>
<div>Of hundred thousand dangers West have won,</div>
<div>In this short watch that ushers in the night</div>
<div>Of all your senses, ere your day be done,</div>
<div>Refuse not to obtain experience new</div>
<div>Of worlds unpeopled, yonder, past the sun.</div>
<div>Consider whence the seed of life ye drew;</div>
<div>Ye were not born to live like brutish herd,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>But righteousness and wisdom to ensue."</div>
<div>My comrades to such eagerness were stirred</div>
<div>By this short speech the course to enter on,</div>
<div>They had no longer brooked restraining word.</div>
<div>Turning our poop to where the morning shone</div>
<div>We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,</div>
<div>Still tending left the further we had gone.</div>
<div>And of the other pole I saw at night</div>
<div>Now all the stars; and 'neath the watery plain</div>
<div>Our own familiar heavens were lost to sight.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>Five times afresh had kindled, and again</div>
<div>The moon's face earthward was illumed no more,</div>
<div>Since out we sailed upon the mighty main;</div>
<div>Then we beheld a lofty mountain soar,</div>
<div>Dim in the distance; higher, as I thought,</div>
<div>By far than any I had seen before.</div>
<div>We joyed; but with despair were soon distraught</div>
<div>When burst a whirlwind from the new-found world</div>
<div>And the forequarter of the vessel caught.</div>
<div>With all the waters thrice it round was swirled;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>At the fourth time the poop, heaved upward, rose,</div>
<div>The prow, as pleased Another, down was hurled;</div>
<div>And then above us did the ocean close.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XXVII.</h2>
<div>Now, having first erect and silent grown</div>
<div>(For it would say no more), from us the flame,</div>
<div>The Poet sweet consenting, had moved on;</div>
<div>And then our eyes were turned to one that came</div>
<div>Behind it on the way, by sounds that burst</div>
<div>Out of its crest in a confused stream.</div>
<div>As the Sicilian bull, which bellowed first</div>
<div>With his lamenting--and it was but right--</div>
<div>Who had prepared it with his tools accurst,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Roared with the howlings of the tortured wight,</div>
<div>So that although constructed all of brass</div>
<div>Yet seemed it pierced with anguish to the height;</div>
<div>So, wanting road and vent by which to pass</div>
<div>Up through the flame, into the flame's own speech</div>
<div>The woeful language all converted was.</div>
<div>But when the words at length contrived to reach</div>
<div>The top, while hither thither shook the crest</div>
<div>As moved the tongue at utterance of each,</div>
<div>We heard: 'Oh thou, to whom are now addressed</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>My words, who spakest now in Lombard phrase:</div>
<div>"Depart; of thee I nothing more request."</div>
<div>Though I be late arrived, yet of thy grace</div>
<div>Let it not irk thee here a while to stay:</div>
<div>It irks not me, yet, as thou seest, I blaze.</div>
<div>If lately to this world devoid of day</div>
<div>From that sweet Latian land thou art come down</div>
<div>Whence all my guilt I bring, declare and say</div>
<div>Has now Romagna peace? because my own</div>
<div>Native abode was in the mountain land</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>'Tween springs of Tiber and Urbino town.'</div>
<div>While I intent and bending low did stand,</div>
<div>My Leader, as he touched me on the side,</div>
<div>'Speak thou, for he is Latian,' gave command.</div>
<div>Whereon without delay I thus replied--</div>
<div>Because already was my speech prepared:</div>
<div>'Soul, that down there dost in concealment 'bide,</div>
<div>In thy Romagna wars have never spared</div>
<div>And spare not now in tyrants' hearts to rage;</div>
<div>But when I left it there was none declared.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>No change has fallen Ravenna for an age.</div>
<div>There, covering Cervia too with outspread wing,</div>
<div>Polenta's Eagle guards his heritage.</div>
<div>Over the city which long suffering</div>
<div>Endured, and Frenchmen slain on Frenchmen rolled,</div>
<div>The Green Paws once again protection fling.</div>
<div>The Mastiffs of Verrucchio, young and old,</div>
<div>Who to Montagna brought such evil cheer,</div>
<div>Still clinch their fangs where they were wont to hold.</div>
<div>Cities, Lamone and Santerno near,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>The Lion couched in white are governed by</div>
<div>Which changes party with the changing year.</div>
<div>And that to which the Savio wanders nigh</div>
<div>As it is set 'twixt mountain and champaign</div>
<div>Lives now in freedom now 'neath tyranny.</div>
<div>But who thou art I to be told am fain:</div>
<div>Be not more stubborn than we others found,</div>
<div>As thou on earth illustrious wouldst remain.'</div>
<div>When first the fire a little while had moaned</div>
<div>After its manner, next the pointed crest</div>
<div>Waved to and fro; then in this sense breathed sound:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">61</aside>'If I believed my answer were addressed</div>
<div>To one that earthward shall his course retrace,</div>
<div>This flame should forthwith altogether rest.</div>
<div>But since none ever yet out of this place</div>
<div>Returned alive, if all be true I hear,</div>
<div>I yield thee answer fearless of disgrace.</div>
<div>I was a warrior, then a Cordelier;</div>
<div>Thinking thus girt to purge away my stain:</div>
<div>And sure my hope had met with answer clear</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Had not the High Priest--ill with him remain!</div>
<div>Plunged me anew into my former sin:</div>
<div>And why and how, I would to thee make plain.</div>
<div>While I the frame of bones and flesh was in</div>
<div>My mother gave me, all the deeds I wrought</div>
<div>Were fox-like and in no wise leonine.</div>
<div>Of every wile and hidden way I caught</div>
<div>The secret trick, and used them with such sleight</div>
<div>That all the world with fame of it was fraught.</div>
<div>When I perceived I had attained quite</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>The time of life when it behoves each one</div>
<div>To furl his sails and coil his cordage tight,</div>
<div>Sorrowing for deeds I had with pleasure done,</div>
<div>Contrite and shriven, I religious grew.</div>
<div>Ah, wretched me! and well it was begun</div>
<div>But for the Chieftain of the Pharisees new,</div>
<div>Then waging war hard by the Lateran,</div>
<div>And not with Saracen nor yet with Jew;</div>
<div>For Christian were his enemies every man,</div>
<div>And none had at the siege of Acre been</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Or trafficked in the Empire of Soldan.</div>
<div>His lofty office he held cheap, and e'en</div>
<div>His Sacred Orders and the cord I wore,</div>
<div>Which used to make the wearers of it lean.</div>
<div>As from Soracte Constantine of yore</div>
<div>Sylvester called to cure his leprosy,</div>
<div>I as a leech was called this man before</div>
<div>To cure him of his fever which ran high;</div>
<div>My counsel he required, but I stood dumb,</div>
<div>For drunken all his words appeared to be.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>He said; "For fear be in thy heart no room;</div>
<div>Beforehand I absolve thee, but declare</div>
<div>How Palestrina I may overcome.</div>
<div>Heaven I unlock, as thou art well aware,</div>
<div>And close at will; because the keys are twin</div>
<div>My predecessor was averse to bear."</div>
<div>Then did his weighty reasoning on me win</div>
<div>Till to be silent seemed the worst of all;</div>
<div>And, "Father," I replied, "since from this sin</div>
<div>Thou dost absolve me into which I fall--</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>The scant performance of a promise wide</div>
<div>Will yield thee triumph in thy lofty stall."</div>
<div>Francis came for me soon as e'er I died;</div>
<div>But one of the black Cherubim was there</div>
<div>And "Take him not, nor rob me of him" cried,</div>
<div>"For him of right among my thralls I bear</div>
<div>Because he offered counsel fraudulent;</div>
<div>Since when I've had him firmly by the hair.</div>
<div>None is absolved unless he first repent;</div>
<div>Nor can repentance house with purpose ill,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>For this the contradiction doth prevent."</div>
<div>Ah, wretched me! How did I shrinking thrill</div>
<div>When clutching me he sneered: "Perhaps of old</div>
<div>Thou didst not think I had in logic skill."</div>
<div>He carried me to Minos: Minos rolled</div>
<div>His tail eight times round his hard back; in ire</div>
<div>Biting it fiercely, ere of me he told:</div>
<div>"Among the sinners of the shrouding fire!"</div>
<div>Therefore am I, where thou beholdest, lost;</div>
<div>And, sore at heart, go clothed in such attire.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>What he would say thus ended by the ghost,</div>
<div>Away from us the moaning flame did glide</div>
<div>While to and fro its pointed horn was tossed.</div>
<div>But we passed further on, I and my Guide,</div>
<div>Along the cliff to where the arch is set</div>
<div>O'er the next moat, where paying they reside,</div>
<div>As schismatics who whelmed themselves in debt.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXVIII.</h2>
<div>Could any, even in words unclogged by rhyme</div>
<div>Recount the wounds that now I saw, and blood,</div>
<div>Although he aimed at it time after time?</div>
<div>Here every tongue must fail of what it would,</div>
<div>Because our human speech and powers of thought</div>
<div>To grasp so much come short in aptitude.</div>
<div>If all the people were together brought</div>
<div>Who in Apulia, land distressed by fate,</div>
<div>Made lamentation for the bloodshed wrought</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>By Rome; and in that war procrastinate</div>
<div>When the large booty of the rings was won,</div>
<div>As Livy writes whose every word has weight;</div>
<div>With those on whom such direful deeds were done</div>
<div>When Robert Guiscard they as foes assailed;</div>
<div>And those of whom still turns up many a bone</div>
<div>At Ceperan, where each Apulian failed</div>
<div>In faith; and those at Tagliacozzo strewed,</div>
<div>Where old Alardo, not by arms, prevailed;</div>
<div>And each his wounds and mutilations showed,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Yet would they far behind by those be left</div>
<div>Who had the vile Ninth Bolgia for abode.</div>
<div>No cask, of middle stave or end bereft,</div>
<div>E'er gaped like one I saw the rest among,</div>
<div>Slit from the chin all downward to the cleft.</div>
<div>Between his legs his entrails drooping hung;</div>
<div>The pluck and that foul bag were evident</div>
<div>Which changes what is swallowed into dung.</div>
<div>And while I gazed upon him all intent,</div>
<div>Opening his breast his eyes on me he set,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Saying: 'Behold, how by myself I'm rent!</div>
<div>See how dismembered now is Mahomet!</div>
<div>Ali in front of me goes weeping too;</div>
<div>With visage from the chin to forelock split.</div>
<div>By all the others whom thou seest there grew</div>
<div>Scandal and schism while yet they breathed the day;</div>
<div>Because of which they now are cloven through.</div>
<div>There stands behind a devil on the way,</div>
<div>Us with his sword thus cruelly to trim:</div>
<div>He cleaves again each of our company</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>As soon as we complete the circuit grim;</div>
<div>Because the wounds of each are healed outright</div>
<div>Or e'er anew he goes in front of him.</div>
<div>But who art thou that peerest from the height,</div>
<div>It may be putting off to reach the pain</div>
<div>Which shall the crimes confessed by thee requite?'</div>
<div>'Death has not seized him yet, nor is he ta'en</div>
<div>To torment for his sins,' my Master said;</div>
<div>'But, that he may a full experience gain,</div>
<div>By me, a ghost, 'tis doomed he should be led</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Down the Infernal circles, round on round;</div>
<div>And what I tell thee is the truth indeed.'</div>
<div>A hundred shades and more, to whom the sound</div>
<div>Had reached, stood in the moat to mark me well,</div>
<div>Their pangs forgot; so did the words astound.</div>
<div>'Let Fra Dolcin provide, thou mayst him tell--</div>
<div>Thou, who perchance ere long shalt sunward go--</div>
<div>Unless he soon would join me in this Hell,</div>
<div>Much food, lest aided by the siege of snow</div>
<div>The Novarese should o'er him victory get,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Which otherwise to win they would be slow.'</div>
<div>While this was said to me by Mahomet</div>
<div>One foot he held uplifted; to the ground</div>
<div>He let it fall, and so he forward set</div>
<div>Next, one whose throat was gaping with a wound,</div>
<div>Whose nose up to the brows away was sheared</div>
<div>And on whose head a single ear was found,</div>
<div>At me, with all the others, wondering peered;</div>
<div>And, ere the rest, an open windpipe made,</div>
<div>The outside of it all with crimson smeared.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>'O thou, not here because of guilt,' he said;</div>
<div>'And whom I sure on Latian ground did know</div>
<div>Unless by strong similitude betrayed,</div>
<div>Upon Pier da Medicin bestow</div>
<div>A thought, shouldst thou revisit the sweet plain</div>
<div>That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo.</div>
<div>And make thou known to Fano's worthiest twain--</div>
<div>To Messer Guido and to Angiolel--</div>
<div>They, unless foresight here be wholly vain,</div>
<div>Thrown overboard in gyve and manacle</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Shall drown fast by Cattolica, as planned</div>
<div>By treachery of a tyrant fierce and fell.</div>
<div>Between Majolica and Cyprus strand</div>
<div>A blacker crime did Neptune never spy</div>
<div>By pirates wrought, or even by Argives' hand.</div>
<div>The traitor who is blinded of an eye,</div>
<div>Lord of the town which of my comrades one</div>
<div>Had been far happier ne'er to have come nigh,</div>
<div>To parley with him will allure them on,</div>
<div>Then so provide, against Focara's blast</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>No need for them of vow or orison.'</div>
<div>And I: 'Point out and tell, if wish thou hast</div>
<div>To get news of thee to the world conveyed,</div>
<div>Who rues that e'er his eyes thereon were cast?'</div>
<div>On a companion's jaw his hand he laid,</div>
<div>And shouted, while the mouth he open prised:</div>
<div>''Tis this one here by whom no word is said.</div>
<div>He quenched all doubt in Caesar, and advised--</div>
<div>Himself an outlaw--that a man equipped</div>
<div>For strife ran danger if he temporised.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Alas, to look on, how downcast and hipped</div>
<div>Curio, once bold in counsel, now appeared;</div>
<div>With gorge whence by the roots the tongue was ripped.</div>
<div>Another one, whose hands away were sheared,</div>
<div>In the dim air his stumps uplifted high</div>
<div>So that his visage was with blood besmeared,</div>
<div>And, 'Mosca, too, remember!' loud did cry,</div>
<div>'Who said, ah me! "A thing once done is done!"</div>
<div>An evil seed for all in Tuscany.'</div>
<div>I added: 'Yea, and death to every one</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Of thine!' whence he, woe piled on woe, his way</div>
<div>Went like a man with grief demented grown.</div>
<div>But I to watch the gang made longer stay,</div>
<div>And something saw which I should have a fear,</div>
<div>Without more proof, so much as even to say,</div>
<div>But that my conscience bids me have good cheer--</div>
<div>The comrade leal whose friendship fortifies</div>
<div>A man beneath the mail of purpose clear.</div>
<div>I saw in sooth (still seems it 'fore mine eyes),</div>
<div>A headless trunk; with that sad company</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>It forward moved, and on the selfsame wise.</div>
<div>The severed head, clutched by the hair, swung free</div>
<div>Down from the fist, yea, lantern-like hung down;</div>
<div>Staring at us it murmured: 'Wretched me!'</div>
<div>A lamp he made of head-piece once his own;</div>
<div>And he was two in one and one in two;</div>
<div>But how, to Him who thus ordains is known.</div>
<div>Arrived beneath the bridge and full in view,</div>
<div>With outstretched arm his head he lifted high</div>
<div>To bring his words well to us. These I knew:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>'Consider well my grievous penalty,</div>
<div>Thou who, though still alive, art visiting</div>
<div>The people dead; what pain with this can vie?</div>
<div>In order that to earth thou news mayst bring</div>
<div>Of me, that I'm Bertrand de Born know well,</div>
<div>Who gave bad counsel to the Younger King.</div>
<div>I son and sire made each 'gainst each rebel:</div>
<div>David and Absalom were fooled not more</div>
<div>By counsels of the false Ahithophel.</div>
<div>Kinsmen so close since I asunder tore,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Severed, alas! I carry now my brain</div>
<div>From what it grew from in this trunk of yore:</div>
<div>And so I prove the law of pain for pain.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XXIX.</h2>
<div>The many folk and wounds of divers kind</div>
<div>Had flushed mine eyes and set them on the flow,</div>
<div>Till I to weep and linger had a mind;</div>
<div>But Virgil said to me: 'Why gazing so?</div>
<div>Why still thy vision fastening on the crew</div>
<div>Of dismal shades dismembered there below?</div>
<div>Thou didst not thus the other Bolgias view:</div>
<div>Think, if to count them be thine enterprise,</div>
<div>The valley circles twenty miles and two.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Beneath our feet the moon already lies;</div>
<div>The time wears fast away to us decreed;</div>
<div>And greater things than these await thine eyes.'</div>
<div>I answered swift: 'Hadst thou but given heed</div>
<div>To why it was my looks were downward bent,</div>
<div>To yet more stay thou mightest have agreed.'</div>
<div>My Guide meanwhile was moving, and I went</div>
<div>Behind him and continued to reply,</div>
<div>Adding: 'Within the moat on which intent</div>
<div>I now was gazing with such eager eye</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>I trow a spirit weeps, one of my kin,</div>
<div>The crime whose guilt is rated there so high.'</div>
<div>Then said the Master: 'Henceforth hold thou in</div>
<div>Thy thoughts from wandering to him: new things claim</div>
<div>Attention now, so leave him with his sin.</div>
<div>Him saw I at thee from the bridge-foot aim</div>
<div>A threatening finger, while he made thee known;</div>
<div>Geri del Bello heard I named his name.</div>
<div>But, at the time, thou wast with him alone</div>
<div>Engrossed who once held Hautefort, nor the place</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Didst look at where he was; so passed he on.'</div>
<div>'O Leader mine! death violent and base,</div>
<div>And not avenged as yet,' I made reply,</div>
<div>'By any of his partners in disgrace,</div>
<div>Made him disdainful; therefore went he by</div>
<div>And spake not with me, if I judge aright;</div>
<div>Which does the more my ruth intensify.'</div>
<div>So we conversed till from the cliff we might</div>
<div>Of the next valley have had prospect good</div>
<div>Down to the bottom, with but clearer light.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>When we above the inmost Cloister stood</div>
<div>Of Malebolge, and discerned the crew</div>
<div>Of such as there compose the Brotherhood,</div>
<div>So many lamentations pierced me through--</div>
<div>And barbed with pity all the shafts were sped--</div>
<div>My open palms across my ears I drew.</div>
<div>From Valdichiana's every spital bed</div>
<div>All ailments to September from July,</div>
<div>With all in Maremma and Sardinia bred,</div>
<div>Heaped in one pit a sickness might supply</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Like what was here; and from it rose a stink</div>
<div>Like that which comes from limbs that putrefy.</div>
<div>Then we descended by the utmost brink</div>
<div>Of the long ridge--leftward once more we fell--</div>
<div>Until my vision, quickened now, could sink</div>
<div>Deeper to where Justice infallible,</div>
<div>The minister of the Almighty Lord,</div>
<div>Chastises forgers doomed on earth to Hell.</div>
<div>Aegina could no sadder sight afford,</div>
<div>As I believe (when all the people ailed</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>And all the air was so with sickness stored,</div>
<div>Down to the very worms creation failed</div>
<div>And died, whereon the pristine folk once more,</div>
<div>As by the poets is for certain held,</div>
<div>From seed of ants their family did restore),</div>
<div>Than what was offered by that valley black</div>
<div>With plague-struck spirits heaped upon the floor.</div>
<div>Supine some lay, each on the other's back</div>
<div>Or stomach; and some crawled with crouching gait</div>
<div>For change of place along the doleful track.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Speechless we moved with step deliberate,</div>
<div>With eyes and ears on those disease crushed down</div>
<div>Nor left them power to lift their bodies straight.</div>
<div>I saw two sit, shoulder to shoulder thrown</div>
<div>As plate holds plate up to be warmed, from head</div>
<div>Down to the feet with scurf and scab o'ergrown.</div>
<div>Nor ever saw I curry-comb so plied</div>
<div>By varlet with his master standing by,</div>
<div>Or by one kept unwillingly from bed,</div>
<div>As I saw each of these his scratchers ply</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>Upon himself; for nought else now avails</div>
<div>Against the itch which plagues them furiously.</div>
<div>The scab they tore and loosened with their nails,</div>
<div>As with a knife men use the bream to strip,</div>
<div>Or any other fish with larger scales.</div>
<div>'Thou, that thy mail dost with thy fingers rip,'</div>
<div>My Guide to one of them began to say,</div>
<div>'And sometimes dost with them as pincers nip,</div>
<div>Tell, is there any here from Italy</div>
<div>Among you all, so may thy nails suffice</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>For this their work to all eternity.'</div>
<div>'Latians are both of us in this disguise</div>
<div>Of wretchedness,' weeping said one of those;</div>
<div>'But who art thou, demanding on this wise?'</div>
<div>My Guide made answer: 'I am one who goes</div>
<div>Down with this living man from steep to steep</div>
<div>That I to him Inferno may disclose.'</div>
<div>Then broke their mutual prop; trembling with deep</div>
<div>Amazement each turned to me, with the rest</div>
<div>To whom his words had echoed in the heap.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>Me the good Master cordially addressed:</div>
<div>'Whate'er thou hast a mind to ask them, say.'</div>
<div>And since he wished it, thus I made request:</div>
<div>'So may remembrance of you not decay</div>
<div>Within the upper world out of the mind</div>
<div>Of men, but flourish still for many a day,</div>
<div>As ye shall tell your names and what your kind:</div>
<div>Let not your vile, disgusting punishment</div>

<h2>CANTO XXX.</h2>
<div>Because of Semele when Juno's ire</div>
<div>Was fierce 'gainst all that were to Thebes allied,</div>
<div>As had been proved by many an instance dire;</div>
<div>So mad grew Athamas that when he spied</div>
<div>His wife as she with children twain drew near,</div>
<div>Each hand by one encumbered, loud he cried:</div>
<div>'Be now the nets outspread, that I may snare</div>

<div>And stretching claws of all compassion bare</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>He on Learchus seized and swung him round,</div>

<div>The Trojans' pride, inordinate before--</div>
<div>Monarch and kingdom equally undone--</div>
<div>Hecuba, sad and captive, mourning o'er</div>
<div>Polyxena, when dolorous she beheld</div>
<div>The body of her darling Polydore</div>
<div>Upon the coast, out of her wits she yelled,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>And spent herself in barking like a hound;</div>
<div>So by her sorrow was her reason quelled.</div>
<div>But never yet was Trojan fury found,</div>
<div>Nor that of Thebes, to sting so cruelly</div>
<div>Brute beasts, far less the human form to wound,</div>
<div>As two pale naked shades were stung, whom I</div>
<div>Saw biting run, like swine when they escape</div>
<div>Famished and eager from the empty sty.</div>
<div>Capocchio coming up to, in his nape</div>
<div>One fixed his fangs, and hauling at him made</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>His belly on the stony pavement scrape.</div>
<div>The Aretine who stood, still trembling, said:</div>
<div>'That imp is Gianni Schicchi, and he goes</div>
<div>Rabid, thus trimming others.' 'O!' I prayed,</div>
<div>'So may the teeth of the other one of those</div>
<div>Not meet in thee, as, ere she pass from sight,</div>
<div>Thou freely shalt the name of her disclose.'</div>
<div>And he to me: 'That is the ancient sprite</div>

<div>While he Buoso Donate's form did feign.'</div>
<div>And when the rabid couple from us went,</div>

<div>Till paunch grows out of keeping with the face,</div>
<div>Compelled him widely ope to hold his lips</div>

<div>A blow by Master Adam at his face</div>
<div>With arm no whit less hard, while he exclaimed:</div>
<div>'What though I can no longer shift my place</div>
<div>Because my members by disease are weighed!</div>
<div>I have an arm still free for such a case.'</div>
<div>To which was answered: 'When thou wast conveyed</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Unto the fire 'twas not thus good at need,</div>
<div>But even more so when the coiner's trade</div>

<h2>CANTO XXXI.</h2>
<div>The very tongue that first had caused me pain,</div>
<div>Biting till both my cheeks were crimsoned o'er,</div>
<div>With healing medicine me restored again.</div>
<div>So have I heard, the lance Achilles bore,</div>
<div>Which earlier was his father's, first would wound</div>
<div>And then to health the wounded part restore.</div>
<div>From that sad valley we our backs turned round,</div>
<div>Up the encircling rampart making way</div>
<div>Nor uttering, as we crossed it, any sound.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Here was it less than night and less than day,</div>
<div>And scarce I saw at all what lay ahead;</div>
<div>But of a trumpet the sonorous bray--</div>
<div>No thunder-peal were heard beside it--led</div>
<div>Mine eyes along the line by which it passed,</div>
<div>Till on one spot their gaze concentrated.</div>
<div>When by the dolorous rout was overcast</div>
<div>The sacred enterprise of Charlemagne</div>
<div>Roland blew not so terrible a blast.</div>
<div>Short time my head was that way turned, when plain</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>I many lofty towers appeared to see.</div>
<div>'Master, what town is this?' I asked. 'Since fain</div>
<div>Thou art,' he said, 'to pierce the obscurity</div>
<div>While yet through distance 'tis inscrutable,</div>
<div>Thou must of error needs the victim be.</div>
<div>Arriving there thou shalt distinguish well</div>
<div>How much by distance was thy sense betrayed;</div>
<div>Therefore to swifter course thyself compel.'</div>
<div>Then tenderly he took my hand, and said:</div>
<div>'Ere we pass further I would have thee know,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>That at the fact thou mayst be less dismayed,</div>
<div>These are not towers but giants; in a row</div>
<div>Set round the brink each in the pit abides,</div>
<div>His navel hidden and the parts below.'</div>
<div>And even as when the veil of mist divides</div>
<div>Little by little dawns upon the sight</div>
<div>What the obscuring vapour earlier hides;</div>
<div>So, piercing the gross air uncheered by light,</div>
<div>As I step after step drew near the bound</div>
<div>My error fled, but I was filled with fright.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>As Montereggion with towers is crowned</div>
<div>Which from the walls encircling it arise;</div>
<div>So, rising from the pit's encircling mound,</div>
<div>Half of their bodies towered before mine eyes--</div>
<div>Dread giants, still by Jupiter defied</div>
<div>From Heaven whene'er it thunders in the skies.</div>
<div>The face of one already I descried,</div>
<div>His shoulders, breast, and down his belly far,</div>
<div>And both his arms dependent by his side.</div>
<div>When Nature ceased such creatures as these are</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>To form, she of a surety wisely wrought</div>
<div>Wresting from Mars such ministers of war.</div>
<div>And though she rue not that to life she brought</div>
<div>The whale and elephant, who deep shall read</div>
<div>Will justify her wisdom in his thought;</div>
<div>For when the powers of intellect are wed</div>
<div>To strength and evil will, with them made one,</div>
<div>The race of man is helpless left indeed.</div>
<div>As large and long as is St. Peter's cone</div>
<div>At Rome, the face appeared; of every limb</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>On scale like this was fashioned every bone.</div>
<div>So that the bank, which covered half of him</div>
<div>As might a tunic, left uncovered yet</div>
<div>So much that if to his hair they sought to climb</div>
<div>Three Frisians end on end their match had met;</div>
<div>For thirty great palms I of him could see,</div>
<div>Counting from where a man's cloak-clasp is set.</div>
<div>Rafel mai amech zabi almi!</div>
<div>Out of the bestial mouth began to roll,</div>
<div>Which scarce would suit more dulcet psalmody.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>And then my Leader charged him: 'Stupid soul,</div>
<div>Stick to thy horn. With it relieve thy mind</div>
<div>When rage or other passions pass control.</div>
<div>Feel at thy neck, round which the thong is twined</div>
<div>O puzzle-headed wretch! from which 'tis slung;</div>
<div>Clipping thy monstrous breast thou shalt it find.'</div>
<div>And then to me: 'From his own mouth is wrung</div>
<div>Proof of his guilt. 'Tis Nimrod, whose insane</div>
<div>Whim hindered men from speaking in one tongue.</div>
<div>Leave we him here nor spend our speech in vain;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>For words to him in any language said,</div>
<div>As unto others his, no sense contain.'</div>
<div>Turned to the left, we on our journey sped,</div>
<div>And at the distance of an arrow's flight</div>
<div>We found another huger and more dread.</div>
<div>By what artificer thus pinioned tight</div>
<div>I cannot tell, but his left arm was bound</div>
<div>In front, as at his back was bound the right,</div>
<div>By a chain which girt him firmly round and round;</div>
<div>About what of his frame there was displayed</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Below the neck, in fivefold gyre 'twas wound.</div>
<div>'Incited by ambition this one made</div>
<div>Trial of prowess 'gainst Almighty Jove,'</div>
<div>My Leader told, 'and he is thus repaid.</div>
<div>'Tis Ephialtes, mightily who strove</div>
<div>What time the giants to the gods caused fright:</div>
<div>The arms he wielded then no more will move.'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'Fain would I, if I might,</div>
<div>On the enormous Briareus set eye,</div>
<div>And know the truth by holding him in sight.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>'Antaeus thou shalt see,' he made reply,</div>
<div>'Ere long, and he can speak, nor is in chains.</div>
<div>Us to the depth of all iniquity</div>
<div>He shall let down. The one thou'dst see remains</div>
<div>Far off, like this one bound and like in make,</div>
<div>But in his face far more of fierceness reigns.'</div>
<div>Never when earth most terribly did quake</div>
<div>Shook any tower so much as what all o'er</div>
<div>And suddenly did Ephialtes shake.</div>
<div>Terror of death possessed me more and more;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>The fear alone had served my turn indeed,</div>
<div>But that I marked the ligatures he wore.</div>
<div>Then did we somewhat further on proceed,</div>
<div>Reaching Antaeus who for good five ell,</div>
<div>His head not counted, from the pit was freed.</div>
<div>'O thou who from the fortune-haunted dell--</div>
<div>Where Scipio of glory was made heir</div>
<div>When with his host to flight turned Hannibal--</div>
<div>A thousand lions didst for booty bear</div>
<div>Away, and who, hadst thou but joined the host</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>And like thy brethren fought, some even aver</div>
<div>The victory to earth's sons had not been lost,</div>
<div>Lower us now, nor disobliging show,</div>
<div>To where Cocytus fettered is by frost.</div>
<div>To Tityus nor to Typhon make us go.</div>
<div>To grant what here is longed for he hath power,</div>
<div>Cease them to curl thy snout, but bend thee low.</div>
<div>He can for wage thy name on earth restore;</div>
<div>He lives, and still expecteth to live long,</div>
<div>If Grace recall him not before his hour.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>So spake my Master. Then his hands he swung</div>
<div>Downward and seized my Leader in all haste--</div>
<div>Hands in whose grip even Hercules once was wrung.</div>
<div>And Virgil when he felt them round him cast</div>
<div>Said: 'That I may embrace thee, hither tend,'</div>
<div>And in one bundle with him made me fast.</div>
<div>And as to him that under Carisend</div>
<div>Stands on the side it leans to, while clouds fly</div>
<div>Counter its slope, the tower appears to bend;</div>
<div>Even so to me who stood attentive by</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>Antaeus seemed to stoop, and I, dismayed,</div>
<div>Had gladly sought another road to try.</div>
<div>But us in the abyss he gently laid,</div>
<div>Where Lucifer and Judas gulfed remain;</div>
<div>Nor to it thus bent downward long time stayed,</div>
<div>But like a ship's mast raised himself again.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXII.</h2>
<div>Had I sonorous rough rhymes at command,</div>
<div>Such as would suit the cavern terrible</div>
<div>Rooted on which all the other ramparts stand,</div>
<div>The sap of fancies which within me swell</div>
<div>Closer I'd press; but since I have not these,</div>
<div>With some misgiving I go on to tell.</div>
<div>For 'tis no task to play with as you please,</div>
<div>Of all the world the bottom to portray,</div>
<div>Nor one that with a baby speech agrees.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>But let those ladies help me with my lay</div>
<div>Who helped Amphion walls round Thebes to pile,</div>
<div>And faithful to the facts my words shall stay.</div>
<div>O 'bove all creatures wretched, for whose vile</div>
<div>Abode 'tis hard to find a language fit,</div>
<div>As sheep or goats ye had been happier! While</div>
<div>We still were standing in the murky pit--</div>
<div>Beneath the giant's feet set far below--</div>
<div>And at the high wall I was staring yet,</div>
<div>When this I heard: 'Heed to thy steps bestow,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Lest haply by thy soles the heads be spurned</div>
<div>Of wretched brothers wearied in their woe.'</div>
<div>Before me, as on hearing this I turned,</div>
<div>Beneath my feet a frozen lake, its guise</div>
<div>Rather of glass than water, I discerned.</div>
<div>In all its course on Austrian Danube lies</div>
<div>No veil in time of winter near so thick,</div>
<div>Nor on the Don beneath its frigid skies,</div>
<div>As this was here; on which if Tabernicch</div>
<div>Or Mount Pietrapana should alight</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>Not even the edge would answer with a creak.</div>
<div>And as the croaking frog holds well in sight</div>
<div>Its muzzle from the pool, what time of year</div>
<div>The peasant girl of gleaning dreams at night;</div>
<div>The mourning shades in ice were covered here,</div>
<div>Seen livid up to where we blush with shame.</div>
<div>In stork-like music their teeth chattering were.</div>
<div>With downcast face stood every one of them:</div>
<div>To cold from every mouth, and to despair</div>
<div>From every eye, an ample witness came.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And having somewhat gazed around me there</div>
<div>I to my feet looked down, and saw two pressed</div>
<div>So close together, tangled was their hair,</div>
<div>'Say, who are you with breast thus strained to breast?'</div>
<div>I asked; whereon their necks they backward bent,</div>
<div>And when their upturned faces lay at rest</div>
<div>Their eyes, which earlier were but moistened, sent</div>
<div>Tears o'er their eyelids: these the frost congealed</div>
<div>And fettered fast before they further went.</div>
<div>Plank set to plank no rivet ever held</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>More firmly; wherefore, goat-like, either ghost</div>
<div>Butted the other; so their wrath prevailed.</div>
<div>And one who wanted both ears, which the frost</div>
<div>Had bitten off, with face still downward thrown,</div>
<div>Asked: 'Why with us art thou so long engrossed?</div>
<div>If who that couple are thou'dst have made known--</div>
<div>The vale down which Bisenzio's floods decline</div>
<div>Was once their father Albert's and their own.</div>
<div>One body bore them: search the whole malign</div>
<div>Caina, and thou shalt not any see</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;</div>
<div>Not he whose breast and shadow equally</div>
<div>Were by one thrust of Arthur's lance pierced through:</div>
<div>Nor yet Focaccia; nor the one that me</div>
<div>With his head hampers, blocking out my view,</div>
<div>Whose name was Sassol Mascheroni: well</div>
<div>Thou must him know if thou art Tuscan too.</div>
<div>And that thou need'st not make me further tell--</div>
<div>I'm Camicion de' Pazzi, and Carlin</div>
<div>I weary for, whose guilt shall mine excel.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>A thousand faces saw I dog-like grin,</div>
<div>Frost-bound; whence I, as now, shall always shake</div>
<div>Whenever sight of frozen pools I win.</div>
<div>While to the centre we our way did make</div>
<div>To which all things converging gravitate,</div>
<div>And me that chill eternal caused to quake;</div>
<div>Whether by fortune, providence, or fate,</div>
<div>I know not, but as 'mong the heads I went</div>
<div>I kicked one full in the face; who therefore straight</div>
<div>'Why trample on me?' snarled and made lament,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>'Unless thou com'st to heap the vengeance high</div>
<div>For Montaperti, why so virulent</div>
<div>'Gainst me?' I said: 'Await me here till I</div>
<div>By him, O Master, shall be cleared of doubt;</div>
<div>Then let my pace thy will be guided by.'</div>
<div>My Guide delayed, and I to him spake out,</div>
<div>While he continued uttering curses shrill:</div>
<div>'Say, what art thou, at others thus to shout?'</div>
<div>'But who art thou, that goest at thy will</div>
<div>Through Antenora, trampling on the face</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>Of others? 'Twere too much if thou wert still</div>
<div>In life.' 'I live, and it may help thy case,'</div>
<div>Was my reply, 'if thou renown wouldst gain,</div>
<div>Should I thy name upon my tablets place.'</div>
<div>And he: 'I for the opposite am fain.</div>
<div>Depart thou hence, nor work me further dool;</div>
<div>Within this swamp thou flatterest all in vain.'</div>
<div>Then I began him by the scalp to pull,</div>
<div>And 'Thou must tell how thou art called,' I said,</div>
<div>'Or soon thy hair will not be plentiful.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And he: 'Though every hair thou from me shred</div>
<div>I will not tell thee, nor my face turn round;</div>
<div>No, though a thousand times thou spurn my head.'</div>
<div>His locks ere this about my fist were wound,</div>
<div>And many a tuft I tore, while dog-like wails</div>
<div>Burst from him, and his eyes still sought the ground.</div>
<div>Then called another: 'Bocca, what now ails?</div>
<div>Is't not enough thy teeth go chattering there,</div>
<div>But thou must bark? What devil thee assails?'</div>
<div>'Ah! now,' said I, 'thou need'st not aught declare,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Accursed traitor; and true news of thee</div>
<div>To thy disgrace I to the world will bear.'</div>
<div>'Begone, tell what thou wilt,' he answered me;</div>
<div>'But, if thou issue hence, not silent keep</div>
<div>Of him whose tongue but lately wagged so free.</div>
<div>He for the Frenchmen's money here doth weep.</div>
<div>Him of Duera saw I, mayst thou tell,</div>
<div>Where sinners shiver in the frozen deep.</div>
<div>Shouldst thou be asked who else within it dwell--</div>
<div>Thou hast the Beccheria at thy side;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Across whose neck the knife at Florence fell.</div>

<div>Him had we left, our journey to pursue,</div>
<div>When frozen in a hole a pair I saw;</div>
<div>One's head like the other's hat showed to the view.</div>
<div>And, as their bread men hunger-driven gnaw,</div>
<div>The uppermost tore fiercely at his mate</div>
<div>Where nape and brain-pan to a junction draw.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>No worse by Tydeus in his scornful hate</div>

<div>'O thou who provest by such bestial act</div>
<div>Hatred of him who by thy teeth is chewed,</div>
<div>Declare thy motive,' said I, 'on this pact--</div>
<div>That if with reason thou with him hast feud,</div>

<div>I in the world to thee will make it good;</div>
<div>If what I speak with dry not ere the time.'</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXIII.</h2>
<div>His mouth uplifting from the savage feast,</div>
<div>The sinner rubbed and wiped it free of gore</div>
<div>On the hair of the head he from behind laid waste;</div>
<div>And then began: 'Thou'dst have me wake once more</div>
<div>A desperate grief, of which to think alone,</div>
<div>Ere I have spoken, wrings me to the core.</div>
<div>But if my words shall be as seed that sown</div>
<div>May fructify unto the traitor's shame</div>
<div>Whom thus I gnaw, I mingle speech and groan.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Of how thou earnest hither or thy name</div>
<div>I nothing know, but that a Florentine</div>
<div>In very sooth thou art, thy words proclaim.</div>
<div>Thou then must know I was Count Ugolin,</div>
<div>The Archbishop Roger he. Now hearken well</div>
<div>Why I prove such a neighbour. How in fine,</div>
<div>And flowing from his ill designs, it fell</div>
<div>That I, confiding in his words, was caught</div>
<div>Then done to death, were waste of time to tell.</div>
<div>But that of which as yet thou heardest nought</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>Is how the death was cruel which I met:</div>
<div>Hearken and judge if wrong to me he wrought.</div>
<div>Scant window in the mew whose epithet</div>
<div>Of Famine came from me its resident,</div>
<div>And cooped in which shall many languish yet,</div>
<div>Had shown me through its slit how there were spent</div>
<div>Full many moons, ere that bad dream I dreamed</div>
<div>When of my future was the curtain rent.</div>
<div>Lord of the hunt and master this one seemed,</div>
<div>Chasing the wolf and wolf-cubs on the height</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>By which from Pisan eyes is Lucca hemmed.</div>
<div>With famished hounds well trained and swift of flight,</div>
<div>Lanfranchi and Gualandi in the van,</div>
<div>And Sismond he had set. Within my sight</div>
<div>Both sire and sons--nor long the chase--began</div>
<div>To grow (so seemed it) weary as they fled;</div>
<div>Then through their flanks fangs sharp and eager ran.</div>
<div>When I awoke before the morning spread</div>
<div>I heard my sons all weeping in their sleep--</div>
<div>For they were with me--and they asked for bread.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>Ah! cruel if thou canst from pity keep</div>
<div>At the bare thought of what my heart foreknew;</div>
<div>And if thou weep'st not, what could make thee weep?</div>
<div>Now were they 'wake, and near the moment drew</div>
<div>At which 'twas used to bring us our repast;</div>
<div>But each was fearful lest his dream came true.</div>
<div>And then I heard the under gate made fast</div>
<div>Of the horrible tower, and thereupon I gazed</div>
<div>In my sons' faces, silent and aghast.</div>
<div>I did not weep, for I to stone was dazed:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>They wept, and darling Anselm me besought:</div>
<div>"What ails thee, father? Wherefore thus amazed?"</div>
<div>And yet I did not weep, and answered not</div>
<div>The whole day, and that night made answer none,</div>
<div>Till on the world another sun shone out.</div>
<div>Soon as a feeble ray of light had won</div>
<div>Into our doleful prison, made aware</div>
<div>Of the four faces featured like my own,</div>
<div>Both of my hands I bit at in despair;</div>
<div>And they, imagining that I was fain</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>To eat, arose before me with the prayer:</div>
<div>"O father, 'twere for us an easier pain</div>
<div>If thou wouldst eat us. Thou didst us array</div>
<div>In this poor flesh: unclothe us now again."</div>
<div>I calmed me, not to swell their woe. That day</div>
<div>And the next day no single word we said.</div>
<div>Ah! pitiless earth, that didst unyawning stay!</div>
<div>When we had reached the fourth day, Gaddo, spread</div>
<div>Out at my feet, fell prone; and made demand:</div>
<div>"Why, O my father, offering us no aid?"</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>There died he. Plain as I before thee stand</div>
<div>I saw the three as one by one they failed,</div>
<div>The fifth day and the sixth; then with my hand,</div>
<div>Blind now, I groped for each of them, and wailed</div>
<div>On them for two days after they were gone.</div>
<div>Famine at last, more strong than grief, prevailed,'</div>
<div>When he had uttered this, his eyes all thrown</div>
<div>Awry, upon the hapless skull he fell</div>
<div>With teeth that, dog-like, rasped upon the bone.</div>
<div>Ah, Pisa! byword of the folk that dwell</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>In the sweet country where the Si doth sound,</div>
<div>Since slow thy neighbours to reward thee well</div>
<div>Let now Gorgona and Capraia mound</div>
<div>Themselves where Arno with the sea is blent,</div>
<div>Till every one within thy walls be drowned.</div>
<div>For though report of Ugolino went</div>
<div>That he betrayed thy castles, thou didst wrong</div>
<div>Thus cruelly his children to torment.</div>
<div>These were not guilty, for they were but young,</div>
<div>Thou modern Thebes! Brigata and young Hugh,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>And the other twain of whom above 'tis sung.</div>
<div>We onward passed to where another crew</div>
<div>Of shades the thick-ribbed ice doth fettered keep;</div>
<div>Their heads not downward these, but backward threw.</div>
<div>Their very weeping will not let them weep,</div>
<div>And grief, encountering barriers at their eyes,</div>
<div>Swells, flowing inward, their affliction deep;</div>
<div>For the first tears that issue crystallise,</div>
<div>And fill, like vizor fashioned out of glass,</div>
<div>The hollow cup o'er which the eyebrows rise.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>And though, as 'twere a callus, now my face</div>
<div>By reason of the frost was wholly grown</div>
<div>Benumbed and dead to feeling, I could trace</div>
<div>(So it appeared), a breeze against it blown,</div>
<div>And asked: 'O Master, whence comes this? So low</div>
<div>As where we are is any vapour known?'</div>
<div>And he replied: 'Thou ere long while shalt go</div>
<div>Where touching this thine eye shall answer true,</div>
<div>Discovering that which makes the wind to blow.'</div>
<div>Then from the cold crust one of that sad crew</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>Demanded loud: 'Spirits, for whom they hold</div>
<div>The inmost room, so truculent were you,</div>
<div>Back from my face let these hard veils be rolled,</div>
<div>That I may vent the woe which chokes my heart,</div>
<div>Ere tears again solidify with cold.'</div>
<div>And I to him: 'First tell me who thou art</div>
<div>If thou'dst have help; then if I help not quick</div>
<div>To the bottom of the ice let me depart.'</div>
<div>He answered: 'I am Friar Alberic--</div>
<div>He of the fruit grown in the orchard fell--</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>And here am I repaid with date for fig.'</div>
<div>'Ah!' said I to him, 'art thou dead as well?'</div>
<div>'How now my body fares,' he answered me,</div>
<div>'Up in the world, I have no skill to tell;</div>
<div>For Ptolomaea has this quality--</div>
<div>The soul oft plunges hither to its place</div>
<div>Ere it has been by Atropos set free.</div>
<div>And that more willingly from off my face</div>
<div>Thou mayst remove the glassy tears, know, soon</div>
<div>As ever any soul of man betrays</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>As I betrayed, the body once his own</div>
<div>A demon takes and governs until all</div>
<div>The span allotted for his life be run.</div>
<div>Into this tank headlong the soul doth fall;</div>
<div>And on the earth his body yet may show</div>
<div>Whose shade behind me wintry frosts enthral.</div>
<div>But thou canst tell, if newly come below:</div>
<div>It is Ser Branca d'Oria, and complete</div>
<div>Is many a year since he was fettered so.'</div>
<div>'It seems,' I answered, 'that thou wouldst me cheat,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">140</aside>For Branca d'Oria never can have died:</div>
<div>He sleeps, puts clothes on, swallows drink and meat.'</div>
<div>'Or e'er to the tenacious pitchy tide</div>
<div>Which boils in Malebranche's moat had come</div>
<div>The shade of Michael Zanche,' he replied,</div>
<div>'That soul had left a devil in its room</div>
<div>Within its body; of his kinsmen one</div>
<div>Treacherous with him experienced equal doom.</div>
<div>But stretch thy hand and be its work begun</div>
<div>Of setting free mine eyes.' This did not I.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">150</aside>Twas highest courtesy to yield him none.</div>
<div>Ah, Genoese, strange to morality!</div>
<div>Ye men infected with all sorts of sin!</div>
<div>Out of the world 'tis time that ye should die.</div>
<div>Here, to Romagna's blackest soul akin,</div>
<div>I chanced on one of you; for doing ill</div>
<div>His soul o'erwhelmed Cocytus' floods within,</div>
<div>Though in the flesh he seems surviving still.</div>
<h2>CANTO XXXIV.</h2>
<div>'Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni</div>
<div>Towards where we are; seek then with vision keen,'</div>
<div>My Master bade, 'if trace of him thou spy.'</div>
<div>As, when the exhalations dense have been,</div>
<div>Or when our hemisphere grows dark with night,</div>
<div>A windmill from afar is sometimes seen,</div>
<div>I seemed to catch of such a structure sight;</div>
<div>And then to 'scape the blast did backward draw</div>
<div>Behind my Guide--sole shelter in my plight.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">10</aside>Now was I where (I versify with awe)</div>
<div>The shades were wholly covered, and did show</div>
<div>Visible as in glass are bits of straw.</div>
<div>Some stood upright and some were lying low,</div>
<div>Some with head topmost, others with their feet;</div>
<div>And some with face to feet bent like a bow.</div>
<div>But we kept going on till it seemed meet</div>
<div>Unto my Master that I should behold</div>
<div>The creature once of countenance so sweet.</div>
<div>He stepped aside and stopped me as he told:</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">20</aside>'Lo, Dis! And lo, we are arrived at last</div>
<div>Where thou must nerve thee and must make thee bold,'</div>
<div>How I hereon stood shivering and aghast,</div>
<div>Demand not, Reader; this I cannot write;</div>
<div>So much the fact all reach of words surpassed.</div>
<div>I was not dead, yet living was not quite:</div>
<div>Think for thyself, if gifted with the power,</div>
<div>What, life and death denied me, was my plight.</div>
<div>Of that tormented realm the Emperor</div>
<div>Out of the ice stood free to middle breast;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">30</aside>And me a giant less would overtower</div>
<div>Than would his arm a giant. By such test</div>
<div>Judge then what bulk the whole of him must show,</div>
<div>Of true proportion with such limb possessed.</div>
<div>If he was fair of old as hideous now,</div>
<div>And yet his brows against his Maker raised,</div>
<div>Meetly from him doth all affliction flow.</div>
<div>O how it made me horribly amazed</div>
<div>When on his head I saw three faces grew!</div>
<div>The one vermilion which straight forward gazed;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">40</aside>And joining on to it were other two,</div>
<div>One rising up from either shoulder-bone,</div>
<div>Till to a junction on the crest they drew.</div>
<div>'Twixt white and yellow seemed the right-hand one;</div>
<div>The left resembled them whose country lies</div>
<div>Where valleywards the floods of Nile flow down.</div>
<div>Beneath each face two mighty wings did rise,</div>
<div>Such as this bird tremendous might demand:</div>
<div>Sails of sea-ships ne'er saw I of such size.</div>
<div>Not feathered were they, but in style were planned</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">50</aside>Like a bat's wing: by them a threefold breeze--</div>
<div>For still he flapped them--evermore was fanned,</div>
<div>And through its depths Cocytus caused to freeze.</div>
<div>Down three chins tears for ever made descent</div>
<div>From his six eyes; and red foam mixed with these.</div>
<div>In every mouth there was a sinner rent</div>
<div>By teeth that shred him as a heckle would;</div>
<div>Thus three at once compelled he to lament.</div>
<div>To the one in front 'twas little to be chewed</div>
<div>Compared with being clawed and clawed again,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">60</aside>Till his back-bone of skin was sometimes nude.</div>
<div>'The soul up yonder in the greater pain</div>
<div>Is Judas 'Scariot, with his head among</div>
<div>The teeth,' my Master said, 'while outward strain</div>
<div>His legs. Of the two whose heads are downward hung,</div>
<div>Brutus is from the black jowl pendulous:</div>
<div>See how he writhes, yet never wags his tongue.</div>
<div>The other, great of thew, is Cassius:</div>
<div>But night is rising and we must be gone;</div>
<div>For everything hath now been seen by us.'</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">70</aside>Then, as he bade, I to his neck held on</div>
<div>While he the time and place of vantage chose;</div>
<div>And when the wings enough were open thrown</div>
<div>He grasped the shaggy ribs and clutched them close,</div>
<div>And so from tuft to tuft he downward went</div>
<div>Between the tangled hair and crust which froze.</div>
<div>We to the bulging haunch had made descent,</div>
<div>To where the hip-joint lies in it; and then</div>
<div>My Guide, with painful twist and violent,</div>
<div>Turned round his head to where his feet had been,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">80</aside>And like a climber closely clutched the hair:</div>
<div>I thought to Hell that we returned again.</div>
<div>'Hold fast to me; it needs by such a stair,'</div>
<div>Panting, my Leader said, like man foredone,</div>
<div>'That we from all that wretchedness repair.'</div>
<div>Right through a hole in a rock when he had won,</div>
<div>The edge of it he gave me for a seat</div>
<div>And deftly then to join me clambered on.</div>
<div>I raised mine eyes, expecting they would meet</div>
<div>With Lucifer as I beheld him last,</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">90</aside>But saw instead his upturned legs and feet.</div>
<div>If in perplexity I then was cast,</div>
<div>Let ignorant people think who do not see</div>
<div>What point it was that I had lately passed.</div>
<div>'Rise to thy feet,' my Master said to me;</div>
<div>'The way is long and rugged the ascent,</div>
<div>And at mid tierce the sun must almost be.'</div>
<div>'Twas not as if on palace floors we went:</div>
<div>A dungeon fresh from nature's hand was this;</div>
<div>Rough underfoot, and of light indigent.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">100</aside>'Or ever I escape from the abyss,</div>
<div>O Master,' said I, standing now upright,</div>
<div>'Correct in few words where I think amiss.</div>
<div>Where lies the ice? How hold we him in sight</div>
<div>Set upside down? The sun, how had it skill</div>
<div>In so short while to pass to morn from night?'</div>
<div>And he: 'In fancy thou art standing, still,</div>
<div>On yon side of the centre, where I caught</div>
<div>The vile worm's hair which through the world doth drill.</div>
<div>There wast thou while our downward course I wrought;</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">110</aside>But when I turned, the centre was passed by</div>
<div>Which by all weights from every point is sought.</div>
<div>And now thou standest 'neath the other sky,</div>
<div>Opposed to that which vaults the great dry ground</div>
<div>And 'neath whose summit there did whilom die</div>
<div>The Man whose birth and life were sinless found.</div>
<div>Thy feet are firm upon the little sphere,</div>
<div>On this side answering to Judecca's round.</div>
<div>'Tis evening yonder when 'tis morning here;</div>
<div>And he whose tufts our ladder rungs supplied.</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">120</aside>Fixed as he was continues to appear.</div>
<div>Headlong from Heaven he fell upon this side;</div>
<div>Whereon the land, protuberant here before,</div>
<div>For fear of him did in the ocean hide,</div>
<div>And 'neath our sky emerged: land, as of yore</div>
<div>Still on this side, perhaps that it might shun</div>
<div>His fall, heaved up, and filled this depth no more.'</div>
<div>From Belzebub still widening up and on,</div>
<div>Far-stretching as the sepulchre, extends</div>
<div>A region not beheld, but only known</div>
<div><aside class="versenum">130</aside>By murmur of a brook which through it wends,</div>
<div>Declining by a channel eaten through</div>
<div>The flinty rock; and gently it descends.</div>
<div>My Guide and I, our journey to pursue</div>
<div>To the bright world, upon this road concealed</div>
<div>Made entrance, and no thought of resting knew.</div>
<div>He first, I second, still ascending held</div>
<div>Our way until the fair celestial train</div>
<div>Was through an opening round to me revealed:</div>
<div>And, issuing thence, we saw the stars again.</div>
